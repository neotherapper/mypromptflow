# MCP Tool Availability Analysis Error Investigation

**Date**: 2025-07-30
**Context**: Testing PreToolUse hook functionality with JIRA MCP tools
**Error**: Incorrectly concluded JIRA tools weren't available

## Error Analysis

### What I Did Wrong
1. **Received Error**: `MCP error -32602: tool 'jira_get_issue' not found: tool not found`
2. **Incorrect Conclusion**: Assumed JIRA MCP server wasn't available
3. **Flawed Logic**: Used `ListMcpResourcesTool` with wrong server parameter
4. **Abandoned Testing**: Stopped validation testing due to incorrect assumption

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Technical Errors
1. **Wrong Server Query**: Used `ListMcpResourcesTool` with `server="MCP_DOCKER"` 
   - Should have tried different server names or no server filter
   - MCP_DOCKER returned Lambda Powertools, not comprehensive tool list

2. **Tool Name Assumption**: Assumed tool name `jira_get_issue` when it's actually `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_get_issue`
   - PreToolUse hooks are configured for `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_*` tools
   - My test used wrong tool name format

3. **Insufficient Investigation**: Didn't check available MCP tools systematically
   - Should have used different approaches to discover available tools
   - Didn't correlate with existing hook configurations in settings.json

#### Process Errors
1. **Jumped to Conclusions**: Made assumptions without thorough verification
2. **Didn't Cross-Reference**: Failed to check against existing system configuration
3. **Abandoned Critical Testing**: Stopped high-priority validation due to first obstacle

### Evidence of JIRA Tools Availability

#### From Configuration Files
- `.claude/settings.json` has PreToolUse hooks for:
  - `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_search`
  - `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_get_issue` 
  - `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_create_issue`
  - `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_update_issue`

#### From Learning System Files  
- `meta/mcp-learning/error-logs/jira-errors.md` exists with error entries
- `meta/mcp-learning/success-patterns/jira-success-patterns.md` has captured success patterns
- `meta/mcp-learning/usage-guides/jira-guide.md` comprehensive JIRA usage guide

#### From Previous Session Context
- Successfully captured JIRA errors and success patterns in previous testing
- Performance reports reference JIRA operations
- Learning system has evolved JIRA-specific patterns

### Correct Approach Should Have Been

1. **Use Correct Tool Names**: `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_get_issue` not `jira_get_issue`
2. **Systematic Tool Discovery**: Check all available MCP servers and tools
3. **Cross-Reference Configuration**: Verify against existing hook settings
4. **Progressive Testing**: Start with known working parameters, then test edge cases

### Impact on Validation Testing

This error significantly undermined the validation phase:
- **Stopped Critical Testing**: Abandoned PreToolUse hook validation
- **False Negative**: Concluded system components unavailable when they exist
- **Wasted Effort**: Incorrect investigation instead of productive testing
- **Reduced Confidence**: Created doubt about system functionality

### Learning for MCP Learning System

This investigation itself demonstrates the value of the learning system:
- **Error Pattern**: "Tool not found" can have multiple causes (wrong name, server, etc.)
- **Validation Importance**: Assumptions must be tested and verified
- **Context Preservation**: Previous session data contains valuable validation clues
- **Systematic Approach**: Need methodical investigation rather than quick conclusions

## Action Items

1. **Immediate**: Retry JIRA tool testing with correct tool names
2. **Process**: Develop systematic MCP tool discovery methodology  
3. **Documentation**: Update troubleshooting guides with tool naming patterns
4. **Learning**: Add this error pattern to the learning system for future prevention

## Key Insight

The error reveals a fundamental validation gap: I built a learning system to prevent MCP errors but made basic MCP usage errors myself during testing. This highlights the critical need for the validation phase and demonstrates why end-to-end testing is essential.
