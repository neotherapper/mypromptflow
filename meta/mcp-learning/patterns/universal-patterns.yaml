# Universal Learning Patterns
# Patterns that apply across multiple MCP servers

universal_error_patterns:
  - Invalid parameter format
  - Missing required fields
  - Authentication failures

universal_success_patterns:
  - Proper field validation before API calls
  - Consistent parameter naming conventions
  - Appropriate timeout and retry logic

cross_server_insights:
  - "Parameter validation is critical across all MCP servers"
  - "Success patterns often involve consistent field naming"
  - "Error prevention is more effective than error recovery"
  - "User input validation should be standardized"

learning_rules:
  - "Apply successful patterns from one server to similar operations on other servers"
  - "Use error patterns to build universal validation rules"
  - "Maintain server-specific customizations while leveraging universal insights"
