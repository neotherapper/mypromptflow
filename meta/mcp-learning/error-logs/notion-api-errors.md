## Error Log Entries

## Error #1 - 2025-01-24 (System Test)

### Context & Intent
**What I was trying to do:** Test the MCP Error Learning System with a Notion database query
**User request:** Demonstrate error logging protocol by testing MCP tool functionality
**Expected outcome:** Successful database query or demonstrate error capture system

### Technical Details
**MCP Server:** Notion API (via MCP Docker)
**Tool Used:** mcp__MCP_DOCKER__API-post-database-query
**Parameters Used:**
```json
{
  "database_id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc",
  "page_size": 10
}
```

### Error Information
**Error Message:** 
```
{"status":400,"object":"error","code":"validation_error","message":"path failed validation: path.database_id should be a valid uuid, instead was `\"12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc\"`.","request_id":"1b5c4533-67e5-4aa6-a7d2-5a55e2b4dc3e"}
```

**Error Type:** Parameter Validation (UUID format issue)
**Severity:** Medium (test error, demonstrates system functionality)

### Analysis
**Root Cause:** The database_id parameter, while appearing to be in UUID format, contains quotes in the API request that caused validation failure
**Missing Information:** Valid database ID for actual testing
**Parameter Issues:** UUID parameter being double-quoted or encoded incorrectly by the MCP tool

### Resolution Attempts
1. **Attempt 1:** Used standard UUID format as shown in usage guide → Still failed with validation error
2. **Resolution Status:** Error confirmed system behavior - this demonstrates the error logging protocol working correctly

### Lessons Learned
**For Future Use:**
- [x] UUID format validation error suggests parameter encoding issue in MCP tool
- [x] Error logging protocol successfully captured full context and technical details
- [x] System demonstrates automatic error capture as designed

**Prevention:**
- [x] Check if database_id exists in actual Notion workspace before testing
- [x] Validate that MCP tool doesn't add extra quotes to UUID parameters
- [x] Use valid database IDs from accessible Notion workspaces for real operations

### Frequency Tracking
**First Occurrence:** 2025-01-24
**Frequency:** 1 (system test)
**Last Occurrence:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Resolved (system demonstration complete)

## Error #2 - 2025-07-24 14:30 (Critical Schema Gap)

### Context & Intent
**What I was trying to do:** Implement unified tagging system across all 6 VanguardAI Knowledge Vault databases during Phase 1 of database schema standardization
**User request:** Continue with VanguardAI implementation tasks including unified tagging system
**Expected outcome:** All databases should have comprehensive unified tagging system with 70+ tags as designed in schemas

### Technical Details
**MCP Server:** Notion API (via MCP Docker)
**Tool Used:** mcp__MCP_DOCKER__API-post-database-query (for validation)
**Parameters Used:**
```json
{
  "database_id": "[live-database-ids]",
  "page_size": 10,
  "filter": {"property": "Tags", "multi_select": {"is_not_empty": true}}
}
```

### Error Information
**Error Message:** 
```
While schemas were designed with unified tagging, the live Notion databases only had basic 4-tag systems instead of the intended 70+ tag vocabulary. Additionally, Business Ideas and Tools & Services databases were completely missing Tags properties.
```

**Error Type:** Schema Validation (Design-Implementation Gap)
**Severity:** High (Critical system functionality missing)

### Analysis
**Root Cause:** Major disconnect between file-based schema design and actual live Notion database implementation
**Missing Information:** Live databases had not been updated with the comprehensive unified tagging system from unified-tags-vocabulary.yaml
**Parameter Issues:** Queries expected Tags properties that either didn't exist or had incomplete vocabularies

### Resolution Attempts
1. **Attempt 1:** Query existing tags to validate system → Discovered only 4 basic tags instead of 70+ comprehensive vocabulary
2. **Attempt 2:** Check Business Ideas and Tools & Services databases → Found completely missing Tags properties
3. **Final Resolution:** Systematically implemented complete unified tagging system using MCP API tools across all 6 databases

### Lessons Learned
**For Future Use:**
- [x] Always validate live database schemas against file-based designs before proceeding with operations
- [x] Schema-expectation mismatches are critical system gaps that must be identified early
- [x] File-based design excellence doesn't guarantee live implementation compliance
- [x] Comprehensive validation protocols must check both property existence AND vocabulary completeness

**Prevention:**
- [x] Implement database schema audit as mandatory first step in any unified system work
- [x] Create validation queries that check both property existence and vocabulary coverage
- [x] Establish schema compliance verification procedures before proceeding with dependent operations
- [x] Document expected vs actual schema states for troubleshooting

### Frequency Tracking
**First Occurrence:** 2025-07-24
**Frequency:** 1 (major discovery during system implementation)
**Last Occurrence:** 2025-07-24
**Status:** Resolved (comprehensive unified tagging system now implemented across all databases)

## Patterns and Insights

### Common Issues Identified
*To be populated as patterns emerge*

### Parameter Validation Rules
**Expected Requirements:**
- Database IDs: Must be valid UUIDs
- Page IDs: Must be valid Notion page identifiers
- Rich text: Must follow Notion's rich text object structure
- Properties: Must match database schema definitions

### Resolution Strategies
*To be developed based on successful resolutions*

## Known Working Patterns

### Successful Configurations
*To be documented as successful operations are observed*

### Reliable Parameter Sets
**Database Query Examples:**
```json
{
  "database_id": "[valid-uuid]",
  "page_size": 100,
  "filter": {...},
  "sorts": [...]
}
```

## Prevention Checklist

Based on experienced Notion API issues:

**Before using Notion API tools:**
- [ ] Verify Notion API token is valid and has required permissions
- [ ] Confirm database/page IDs exist and are accessible
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Validate live database schemas match file-based designs (Error #2 learning)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Check that Tags properties exist and have complete vocabularies (Error #2 learning)
- [ ] Validate property schema matches database structure
- [ ] Check rich text formatting follows Notion standards
- [ ] Ensure request doesn't exceed rate limits
- [ ] Verify parent/child relationships are valid
- [ ] **NEW**: Perform schema audit before proceeding with unified system operations
- [ ] **NEW**: Query property existence and vocabulary completeness before dependent operations
