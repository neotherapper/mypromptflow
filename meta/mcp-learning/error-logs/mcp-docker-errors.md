## Error Log Entries

## Error #1 - 2025-01-23 PM

### Context & Intent
**What I was trying to do:** Follow the Mandatory Error Learning Procedures from CLAUDE.md by checking the @meta/mcp-learning directory structure
**User request:** User asked me to follow the MCP Error Learning Protocol and add any encountered errors to error logs
**Expected outcome:** Read the contents of a directory to understand the structure

### Technical Details
**MCP Server:** mcp-docker
**Tool Used:** Read
**Parameters Used:**
```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/georgiospilitsoglou/Developer/projects/mypromptflow/meta/mcp-learning"
}
```

### Error Information
**Error Message:** 
```
EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read
```

**Error Type:** Parameter Validation
**Severity:** Low

### Analysis
**Root Cause:** Used Read tool with directory path instead of file path
**Missing Information:** The tool expects a file, not a directory
**Parameter Issues:** file_path parameter pointed to directory instead of file

### Resolution Attempts
1. **Attempt 1:** Used LS tool with same path â†’ SUCCESS (got directory listing)
2. **Final Resolution:** Used LS tool instead of Read tool for directory inspection

### Lessons Learned
**For Future Use:**
- [x] Use LS tool for directory structure inspection
- [x] Use Read tool only for file content reading
- [x] Check if path is file vs directory before tool selection

**Prevention:**
- [x] Verify path type (file vs directory) before using Read tool
- [x] Use LS for directory inspection
- [x] Use Read for file content access

### Frequency Tracking
**First Occurrence:** 2025-01-23
**Frequency:** 1 time
**Last Occurrence:** 2025-01-23
**Status:** Resolved - Pattern Identified

## Patterns and Insights

### Common Issues Identified
*To be populated as patterns emerge*

### Parameter Validation Rules
*To be established based on error analysis*

### Resolution Strategies
*To be developed based on successful resolutions*

## Known Working Patterns

### Successful Configurations
*To be documented as successful operations are observed*

### Reliable Parameter Sets
*To be established based on successful usage*

## Prevention Checklist

Based on anticipated common issues:

**Before using MCP Docker tools:**
- [ ] Verify Docker containers are running and accessible
- [ ] Check authentication credentials for individual services (Notion, JIRA, etc.)
- [ ] Validate parameter formats match service expectations
- [ ] Ensure network connectivity to external services
- [ ] Review recent error patterns for similar operations

## Integration Notes

**Related Error Logs:**
- This is the primary log for Docker-based MCP tools
- Individual service patterns may also appear in service-specific contexts

## Maintenance

**Last Review:** 2025-01-24 (Initial creation)
**Next Review:** After first 10 errors logged
**Pattern Analysis:** To be performed weekly once data is available
**Guide Updates:** To be synchronized with @meta/mcp-learning/usage-guides/mcp-docker-guide.md
