# AI Agent MCP Server Discovery Workflow
# Comprehensive guide for AI agents to systematically expand knowledge-vault with MCP servers

## Workflow Overview

**Problem Solved**: When an AI agent is asked to "expand the knowledge-vault with MCP servers," this workflow provides complete visibility into:
- Which MCP server sources have been processed and completion percentages
- Which servers exist in the ecosystem vs. what's profiled  
- What discovery gaps exist and next priorities
- How to systematically expand the knowledge system

## üéØ Primary Entry Points for AI Agents

### 1. Ecosystem Intelligence Assessment
```yaml
workflow_step: "Understanding Current State"
files_to_read:
  - "@meta/mcp-system/intelligence/ecosystem-registry.yaml"
  - "@meta/mcp-system/intelligence/source-tracking.yaml"
  
key_information_extracted:
  - total_servers_discovered: 2200+
  - total_profiles_created: 175
  - overall_completion_percentage: 29.2%
  - sources_with_gaps: ["awesome-mcp-servers", "docker_hub_mcp", "github_topic_mcp"]
  
ai_agent_understanding:
  "I can see the complete MCP ecosystem landscape and know exactly what percentage 
   of each source has been profiled. awesome-mcp-servers is 37.5% complete with 
   75 servers remaining to profile."
```

### 2. Gap Analysis and Priority Assessment  
```yaml
workflow_step: "Identifying Expansion Opportunities"
source: "@meta/mcp-system/intelligence/source-tracking.yaml"

gap_analysis_process:
  1. "Read source_progress section for completion percentages"
  2. "Check discovery_gaps.priority_gaps for specific numbers"
  3. "Review recommended_next_actions for systematic expansion"
  
priority_algorithm:
  factors:
    - completion_percentage: "lower = higher priority"
    - quality_level: "official > community > variable"
    - total_servers_discovered: "larger sources get medium priority"
    - estimated_effort: "timeline feasibility assessment"
    
example_priority_output:
  highest_priority: "awesome-mcp-servers (37.5% complete, 75 servers remaining, 4-6 weeks)"
  medium_priority: "docker_hub_mcp (27.1% complete, 62 servers remaining, 3-4 weeks)"
  lower_priority: "github_topic_mcp (15.3% complete, 288 servers remaining, 8-12 weeks)"
```

### 3. Knowledge Vault Integration Check
```yaml
workflow_step: "Validating Existing Profiles"
target: "@knowledge-vault/databases/tools_services/"

validation_process:
  1. "Query existing MCP server profiles in knowledge-vault"
  2. "Cross-reference with ecosystem-registry servers"
  3. "Identify servers in registry but missing profiles"
  4. "Check profile quality and completeness scores"
  
ai_agent_query_pattern: |
  # Example: Find servers that need profiles
  grep -r "mcp.*server" @knowledge-vault/databases/tools_services/items/ |
  compare_with ecosystem-registry.yaml servers list |
  identify_missing_profiles
  
integration_validation:
  - schema_compliance: ">95% of profiles meet tools-services-schema.yaml"
  - relationship_integrity: ">92% cross-references valid"
  - quality_standards: "average composite score >7.5"
```
