## 🤖 AI Agent Quick Start

### Primary Navigation for AI Agents
```yaml
# When asked to "expand knowledge-vault with MCP servers"
ai_agent_workflow:
  step_1: "Read @meta/mcp-system/intelligence/source-tracking.yaml → understand gaps"

  2. "Extract completion percentages and gap sizes"
  3. "Identify highest-priority missing servers"
  4. "Provide specific numbers and timeline estimates"

Expected_Output: |
  "We have profiled 175/600 high-quality MCP servers (29.2% complete). 
   Top gaps: awesome-mcp-servers has 75 missing servers (37.5% complete), 
   docker_hub_mcp has 62 missing servers (27.1% complete). 
   Recommended next action: Focus on awesome-mcp-servers completion (4-6 weeks estimated)."
