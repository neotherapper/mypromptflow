# Future Architecture Files

## Purpose
This directory contains architectural specifications that were created prematurely during session 2025-07-27. These files represent valuable implementation planning but were created before completing the necessary Phase 1 research.

## Files Moved Here
- `universal-mcp-server-pool.yaml` (473 lines) - Universal MCP server pool configuration
- `mcp-orchestration-coordinator.yaml` (359 lines) - Advanced orchestration system
- `deployment-automation.yaml` (587 lines) - Deployment automation framework
- `validation-testing-framework.yaml` (684 lines) - Comprehensive validation system
- `configuration-management-system.yaml` (597 lines) - Configuration management system

**Total**: 2,700+ lines of detailed architecture specifications

## Why Moved
These files assume knowledge we don't yet have:
1. **Which MCP servers to use** - We haven't completed MCP ecosystem research (Phase 1)
2. **What quality frameworks work** - We haven't validated quality assessment approaches
3. **What orchestration patterns are optimal** - We haven't tested coordination strategies
4. **What our actual requirements are** - We haven't built and validated an MVP

## When to Use
These files should be revisited during:
- **Phase 2**: System Architecture & Planning (after Phase 1 research completion)
- **Phase 3**: Implementation (after MVP validation)

The specifications may need significant updates based on:
- Phase 1 research findings
- MVP validation results
- Actual performance requirements
- Integration discoveries

## Value Preservation
While premature, these files contain valuable thinking about:
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure design
- Multi-topic resource optimization
- Comprehensive validation approaches
- Production deployment strategies

This work will inform future architecture decisions but should not drive them until properly validated through research and MVP development.
