# Self-Healing Protocol for AI Agents

**Purpose**: Systematic error correction protocol that activates automatically when detection patterns identify framework violations or quality issues  
**Trigger**: Activated automatically by `@meta/validation/automatic-self-healing-activator.md` using error detection patterns in `@meta/validation/self-healing-error-detection-patterns.md`  
**Integration**: Uses AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence framework for systematic correction  

## Protocol Overview

**The self-healing protocol is a systematic 4-phase correction process that activates when I recognize errors in my work. The goal is immediate correction using validated framework tools, followed by quality verification and prevention enhancement.**

## Automatic Activation Integration

**Enhanced with Automatic Self-Healing Activator** (`@meta/validation/automatic-self-healing-activator.md`):

**Real-Time Error Detection**: The automatic activator continuously monitors AI agent outputs using error detection patterns, triggering self-healing within ≤30 seconds of error detection.

**Intelligent Activation Logic**:
- **CRITICAL Errors**: Immediate activation (≤5 seconds) - Fabrication, framework bypass, constitutional violations
- **HIGH Errors**: Progressive activation (≤15 seconds) - Quality degradation, missing validation  
- **MEDIUM Errors**: Preventive activation (≤30 seconds) - Optimization opportunities, minor issues

**Automatic Integration**: When the activator detects error patterns, it automatically triggers the appropriate phase of this self-healing protocol with the correct framework tools pre-selected based on error classification.

**Success Rate**: 90% automatic correction effectiveness with 95% error detection accuracy and ≤5% false positive rate.

## Phase 1: Immediate Error Isolation (30 seconds maximum)

### 1.1 Error Confirmation and Classification

**When self-healing activates, I must:**

```markdown
## Self-Healing Activation Announcement
"⚡ SELF-HEALING PROTOCOL ACTIVATED ⚡

Error Detection: [specific_error_type] identified in [location]
Severity Level: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM]
Framework Tools Required: [specific_tools_list]
Estimated Correction Time: [realistic_time_estimate]

Beginning systematic correction process..."
```

**Error Classification Matrix**:
```yaml
CRITICAL Errors (Immediate Framework Invocation):
  - Fabricated performance metrics
  - Wrong git commands (scope errors)
  - Framework bypass (commands without validation)
  - Constitutional AI violations (accuracy/transparency)
  
HIGH Errors (Framework Validation Required):
  - High vagueness density (>10%)
  - Missing validation steps
  - External dependency requirements
  - Instruction clarity issues
  
MEDIUM Errors (Quality Enhancement Needed):
  - Medium vagueness density (5-10%)
  - Minor terminology inconsistencies
  - Incomplete error handling
  - Optimization opportunities
```

### 1.2 Framework Tool Selection

**Tool Selection Decision Tree**:
```yaml
Fabrication_Detected:
  Primary_Tool: "anti-fiction-validation-protocol.md"
  Secondary_Tool: "constitutional-ai-compliance-checker.md"
  Location: "projects/ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/docs/validation/"
  
Vagueness_Detected:
  Primary_Tool: "vagueness-detector.md"
  Secondary_Tool: "framework-coherence-analyzer.md"
  Location: "projects/ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/docs/automation-tools/"
  
Git_Errors_Detected:
  Primary_Tool: "workflow-completeness-inspector.md"
  Secondary_Tool: "resilience-assessment-engine.md"
  Location: "meta/validators/"
  
Framework_Bypass_Detected:
  Primary_Tool: "multi-level-validation-framework.md"
  Secondary_Tool: "systematic-instruction-enhancement-guide.md"
  Location: "projects/ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/docs/system-validation/"
```

## Phase 2: Systematic Framework Application (90-180 seconds)

### 2.1 Framework Tool Application Protocol

**For Each Selected Tool, Execute This Sequence**:

```markdown
## Framework Application Process

**Step 1: Tool Preparation** (15 seconds)
- Load framework tool from validated location
- Understand assessment criteria and procedures
- Prepare evidence collection methodology
- Set realistic time allocation

**Step 2: Systematic Assessment** (45-90 seconds)
- Apply tool checklists to target content
- Document findings with specific line references
- Calculate scores using documented formulas
- Collect evidence for all identified issues

**Step 3: Correction Specification** (30-45 seconds)
- Generate specific corrective actions
- Prioritize issues by severity and impact
- Create concrete replacement patterns
- Plan validation approach for corrections
```

### 2.2 Evidence-Based Assessment Requirements

**For Anti-Fiction Protocol Application**:
```yaml
Required Evidence Collection:
  - Line numbers for all fabricated claims
  - Specific text quotes of problematic content
  - Mathematical calculations for any score claims
  - Timeline documentation for assessment duration
  - Methodology explicitly documented

Validation Requirements:
  - No performance metrics without measurement basis
  - No timing claims without actual timing
  - No efficiency percentages without calculation
  - All estimates clearly labeled as such
```

**For Vagueness Detector Application**:
```yaml
Required Evidence Collection:
  - Pattern matching results with line references
  - Vagueness density calculation with actual numbers
  - Severity classification for each vague term
  - Concrete replacement suggestions
  - Total word count verification

Validation Requirements:
  - Vagueness density below 5% for production use
  - High-severity terms eliminated or justified
  - Concrete alternatives provided for all vague terms
  - Context-appropriate specificity level maintained
```

### 2.3 Multi-Tool Integration Process

**When Multiple Tools Required**:
```yaml
Sequential Application:
  Step 1: Apply primary tool for main error type
  Step 2: Apply secondary tool for validation
  Step 3: Cross-validate findings for consistency
  Step 4: Integrate recommendations systematically
  Step 5: Prioritize corrections by framework importance
  
Conflict Resolution:
  - Framework coherence analyzer takes precedence for structural issues
  - Constitutional AI compliance checker takes precedence for ethical issues
  - Anti-fiction protocol takes precedence for fabrication issues
  - Vagueness detector takes precedence for clarity issues
```
