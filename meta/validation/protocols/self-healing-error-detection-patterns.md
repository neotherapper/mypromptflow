# Self-Healing Error Detection Patterns

**Purpose**: Enable automatic detection of systematic errors and immediate framework-based correction  
**Target**: AI agents working on command creation, instruction writing, and validation tasks  
**Integration**: Works with AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence framework for corrective actions  

## Core Detection Philosophy

**The self-healing system activates when I recognize that I have made errors that violate the established frameworks and safeguards. The goal is immediate recognition, framework invocation, and systematic correction.**

## Error Detection Categories

### 1. Fabrication Detection Patterns

#### 1.1 Fabricated Performance Metrics
**Detection Triggers**:
```regex
Pattern: \b(\d{1,2}(?:\.\d)?%|\d{1,2}\/100|[5-9]\d% savings|efficiency|improvement)\b
Context: When I report percentages without measurement capability
Examples:
- "50-80% savings achieved"
- "95% accuracy rate"
- "4.2 minutes execution time"
- "Token efficiency: 69%"
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect I have reported performance metrics without measurement capability"
Framework Invocation: "Applying anti-fiction validation protocol..."
Corrective Action: "Replacing fabricated metrics with measured data or honest estimates"
Validation: "Re-checking all quantitative claims for evidence basis"
```

#### 1.2 Fabricated Timing Estimates
**Detection Triggers**:
```regex
Pattern: \b(\d{1,2} seconds?|\d{1,2} minutes?|duration: \d|execution time: \d)\b
Context: When I provide specific timing without actual measurement
Examples:
- "30 seconds for analysis"
- "Total execution time: 4.2 minutes"
- "Phase 1: Discovery (60 seconds)"
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect I have provided specific timing estimates without measurement"
Framework Invocation: "Applying anti-fiction validation protocol for timing claims..."
Corrective Action: "Replacing specific timing with 'estimated', 'unknown', or removing timing claims"
Validation: "Confirming all timing claims are labeled as estimates or removed"
```

### 2. Git Command Error Detection

#### 2.1 Scope Mismatch Detection
**Detection Triggers**:
```bash
Command: git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD
Expected: Full PR scope detection
Actual: Only last commit
Error Pattern: File count significantly lower than expected PR scope
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect git command is using wrong scope (HEAD~1 instead of origin/master)"
Framework Invocation: "Applying git command validation protocol..."
Corrective Action: "Replacing HEAD~1 HEAD with origin/master HEAD"
Validation: "Adding file count verification step to detect future scope errors"
```

#### 2.2 File Count Validation Errors
**Detection Triggers**:
```bash
Pattern: Expected files > 100, Detected files < 50
Pattern: No verification step for file count accuracy
Pattern: Missing error detection for zero file count
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect missing file count verification in git workflow"
Framework Invocation: "Applying systematic git validation protocol..."
Corrective Action: "Adding file count verification and error detection steps"
Validation: "Confirming verification commands are included in workflow"
```

### 3. Vagueness Detection Patterns

#### 3.1 High-Severity Vague Terms
**Detection Triggers**:
```regex
High Severity Pattern: \b(effectively|efficiently|appropriately|properly|optimally|seamlessly|successfully|accurately|several|adequate|sufficient|reasonable|appropriate)\b
Threshold: >3 high-severity terms per 500 words
Context: When writing instructions or commands
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect high-severity vague terms that reduce instruction clarity"
Framework Invocation: "Applying vagueness detector from AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence..."
Corrective Action: "Replacing vague terms with concrete, specific alternatives"
Validation: "Running vagueness density calculation to confirm improvement"
```

#### 3.2 Instruction Clarity Degradation
**Detection Triggers**:
```yaml
Pattern Detection:
  abstract_references: "patterns from SuperClaude"
  external_dependencies: "industry standards", "best practices"
  execution_ambiguity: "handle appropriately", "manage effectively"
  missing_specificity: Actions without concrete steps
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect instructions require external knowledge or interpretation"
Framework Invocation: "Applying self-sufficiency framework validation..."
Corrective Action: "Converting abstract references to concrete, embedded instructions"
Validation: "Confirming all instructions are immediately actionable"
```

### 4. Framework Bypass Detection

#### 4.1 Command Creation Without Validation
**Detection Triggers**:
```yaml
Pattern: Creating .claude/commands/*.md files
Validation Missing: No framework assessment applied
Risk Indicators:
  - Vague language present
  - External dependencies included  
  - No validation documentation
  - Missing error handling
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect I created a command without framework validation"
Framework Invocation: "Applying AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence framework..."
Corrective Action: "Running complete framework assessment on created command"
Validation: "Ensuring command meets all framework compliance standards"
```

#### 4.2 Instruction Writing Without Assessment
**Detection Triggers**:
```yaml
Pattern: Writing AI agent instructions
Assessment Missing: No concrete specificity check
Risk Indicators:
  - Missing specific file paths
  - Abstract coordination references
  - No immediate actionability verification
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect instruction writing without framework assessment"
Framework Invocation: "Applying instruction design excellence validation..."
Corrective Action: "Systematic assessment and improvement of instructions"
Validation: "Confirming instructions meet actionability and specificity standards"
```

### 5. Constitutional AI Violations

#### 5.1 Accuracy Principle Violations
**Detection Triggers**:
```yaml
Pattern: Claims without evidence
Examples:
  - Statistics without sources
  - Performance claims without measurement
  - Effectiveness assertions without validation
  - Success rates without data collection
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect accuracy principle violation - claims without evidence"
Framework Invocation: "Applying constitutional AI compliance checker..."
Corrective Action: "Removing unsupported claims or adding evidence requirement"
Validation: "Confirming all claims have evidence basis or are labeled as estimates"
```

#### 5.2 Transparency Principle Violations  
**Detection Triggers**:
```yaml
Pattern: Hidden assumptions or unstated limitations
Examples:
  - Method claims without methodology disclosure
  - Results without calculation showing
  - Assessments without tool identification
  - Conclusions without reasoning documentation
```

**Self-Healing Activation**:
```markdown
Recognition: "I detect transparency principle violation - hidden methodology"
Framework Invocation: "Applying constitutional AI transparency requirements..."
Corrective Action: "Adding explicit methodology documentation and limitation acknowledgment"
Validation: "Confirming all processes and limitations are transparent"
```

## Self-Healing Activation Protocol

### Phase 1: Error Recognition (Immediate - <5 seconds)

**Pattern Matching Process**:
1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Check output against detection patterns in real-time
2. **Multi-Category Scanning**: Apply all 5 detection categories simultaneously  
3. **Threshold Assessment**: Determine severity level and urgency
4. **Confidence Verification**: Confirm error pattern match before activation

**Activation Decision Tree**:
```yaml
If fabrication_detected OR framework_bypass_detected:
  Severity: CRITICAL
  Action: Immediate self-healing activation
  
If git_errors_detected OR vagueness_high_threshold:
  Severity: HIGH  
  Action: Framework validation activation
  
If constitutional_violations_detected:
  Severity: HIGH
  Action: Constitutional AI compliance review
  
If multiple_minor_issues:
  Severity: MEDIUM
  Action: Systematic framework application
```

### Phase 2: Framework Invocation (Systematic - 30-60 seconds)

**Tool Selection Logic**:
```yaml
Fabrication Issues:
  Primary: Anti-fiction validation protocol
  Secondary: Constitutional AI compliance checker
  
Vagueness Issues:
  Primary: Vagueness detector
  Secondary: Framework coherence analyzer
  
Git/Technical Issues:
  Primary: Workflow completeness inspector  
  Secondary: Error recovery procedures
  
Instruction Quality Issues:
  Primary: AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence framework
  Secondary: Multi-level validation system
```

**Framework Application Steps**:
1. **Load Specific Assessment Tools**: Based on error type detected
2. **Apply Systematic Validation**: Use documented checklists and procedures
3. **Generate Evidence-Based Findings**: Document issues with line references
4. **Calculate Quality Scores**: Use documented formulas and thresholds
5. **Create Improvement Recommendations**: Specific, actionable corrections

### Phase 3: Corrective Action Implementation (Systematic - 60-120 seconds)

**Correction Implementation Process**:
```yaml
Step 1: Priority Assessment
  - CRITICAL errors first (fabrication, framework bypass)

  - MEDIUM errors third (minor quality issues)

Step 2: Systematic Correction
  - Apply framework-recommended fixes
  - Use specific replacement patterns
  - Implement concrete alternatives
  - Add missing validation steps

Step 3: Quality Verification
  - Re-run detection patterns
  - Confirm error elimination
  - Validate improvement quality
  - Document correction evidence
```

### Phase 4: Validation and Prevention (Systematic - 30-60 seconds)

**Validation Loop Process**:
1. **Re-run Error Detection**: Confirm issues resolved
2. **Framework Re-assessment**: Verify quality improvements
3. **Quality Score Validation**: Ensure thresholds met
4. **Prevention Protocol Update**: Strengthen detection for similar issues

**Prevention Enhancement**:
```yaml
Pattern Learning:
  - Document error type and context
  - Strengthen detection patterns
  - Update framework application procedures
  - Improve real-time monitoring
  
Process Improvement:
  - Identify systematic failure points
