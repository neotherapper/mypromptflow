## AI Agent Instructions

### Phase 1: CLAUDE.md File Discovery and Classification

**AI Agent Execution Steps:**

1. **Identify CLAUDE.md Files**: Use Read tool to analyze file content and structure
2. **Project Classification**: Determine project type and complexity level
3. **Content Analysis**: Parse file structure and identify key sections
4. **Context Assessment**: Evaluate project scope and AI agent requirements

### Phase 2: Required Elements Validation

**For each CLAUDE.md file:**

1. **Essential Components Check**: Validate presence of 9 required elements
2. **Component Quality Assessment**:
   ```yaml
   # Validate project context quality
   project_context_assessment:
     - project_type_clarity: "Clear identification of project type"
     - status_specificity: "Specific status with measurable progress"
     - priority_justification: "Clear priority level with reasoning"
   
   # Validate AI agent instructions quality  
   ai_instructions_assessment:
     - instruction_clarity: "Clear, actionable instructions for AI agents"
     - authority_definition: "Defined agent roles and responsibilities"
     - coordination_protocols: "Specific coordination and reporting patterns"
   ```

3. **Cross-Reference Pattern Validation**:
   ```yaml
   # Good cross-reference patterns to validate:
   cross_reference_examples:
     project_integration: "@projects/ai-knowledge-base-enhancement/docs/claude-comprehensive-capabilities.md"
     research_integration: "@research/orchestrator/integration/claude-orchestrator-integration.yaml"
     command_integration: "@.claude/commands/research.md"
     framework_integration: "@meta/validation/validators/registry.yaml"
   ```

### Phase 3: Claude Integration Excellence Assessment

**Claude-Specific Pattern Analysis:**

1. **Automatic Context Loading Assessment**:
   ```yaml
   # Validate Claude integration patterns:
   claude_integration_patterns:
     recursive_discovery:
       good: "Leverages Claude's recursive file discovery protocol"
       poor: "Requires manual file loading or external references"
     
     hierarchical_loading:
       good: "Uses hierarchical context loading with progressive expansion"
       poor: "Flat structure without context optimization"
     
     memory_system_usage:
       good: "Structured for Claude's three-tier memory system"
       poor: "Generic instructions without Claude-specific optimization"
   ```

2. **Command System Integration Check**:
   ```yaml
   # Assess command system integration quality:
   command_integration_assessment:
     reference_quality:
       good: "References to .claude/commands/ with specific workflows"
       poor: "Generic command references without specific integration"
     
     workflow_coordination:
       good: "Clear coordination between CLAUDE.md and command workflows"
       poor: "Disconnected instructions without workflow integration"
   ```

### Phase 4: AI Agent Instruction Quality Validation

**Design Excellence Framework Application:**

1. **Concrete Specificity Assessment**:
   ```yaml
   # Flag vague language patterns:
   vague_language_detection:
     process_qualifiers: "effectively, efficiently, appropriately, properly"
     quality_descriptors: "good, better, optimal, high-quality"
     quantity_vagueness: "several, some, many, various, appropriate"
     
   # Validate concrete alternatives:
   concrete_specificity_examples:
     vague: "Ensure good quality validation"
     concrete: "Apply ≥95% accuracy threshold with constitutional AI compliance"
   ```

2. **External Dependency Assessment**:
   ```yaml
   # Validate self-sufficiency:
   self_sufficiency_check:
     internal_references: "Count @file_path references to internal documents"
     external_dependencies: "Flag references to external systems or documentation"
     embedded_context: "Validate necessary context is embedded within CLAUDE.md"
   ```

### Phase 5: Quality Scoring and Report Generation

**Comprehensive Scoring System:**

1. **Component Scoring (50 points total)**:
   ```yaml
   component_scoring:
     required_elements_present: "5 points per element × 9 elements = 45 points"
     element_quality_bonus: "1 point per high-quality element = 5 points"
   ```

2. **Claude Integration Scoring (30 points total)**:
   ```yaml
   claude_integration_scoring:
     automatic_context_loading: "5 points for explicit usage"
     cross_reference_patterns: "2 points per valid reference, max 10 points"
     command_integration: "5 points for command system integration"
     memory_persistence: "5 points for memory system optimization"
     multi_file_awareness: "5 points for multi-file coordination"
   ```

3. **Design Excellence Scoring (20 points total)**:
   ```yaml
   design_excellence_scoring:
     concrete_specificity: "10 points minus 2 per vague term"
     external_dependency_elimination: "5 points for self-sufficiency"
     immediate_actionability: "5 points for executable instructions"
   ```
