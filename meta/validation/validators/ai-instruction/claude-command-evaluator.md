  - "Conduct comprehensive research using the intelligent hybrid orchestrator for: $ARGUMENTS"
  - "Please analyze and work on the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS. Follow these steps:"
  
poor_patterns:
  - "This command takes arguments" # No $ARGUMENTS usage
  - "Use $ARGUMENTS parameter" # Redundant explanation
  - "$ARGUMENTS" # Just mentioned without context
```
