## Coherence Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Structural Analysis

**Hierarchy Validation**:
```bash
# Check heading structure consistency
grep -n '^#' [target_file] | head -20

# Validate section organization
grep -n -E '^#{1,4}\s+' [target_file] | nl

# Check for consistent formatting patterns
grep -n -E '^\*\*|^-\s|^\d+\.' [target_file] | head -10
```

**Structural Coherence Scoring**:
```yaml
structural_scoring_formula:
  hierarchy_consistency_score: assessment(heading_levels_logical) * 40
  organization_alignment_score: assessment(section_grouping_logical) * 35
  architecture_validation_score: assessment(structure_standardized) * 25
  total_structural_score: sum(above_components) # max 100
```

### Phase 2: Semantic Analysis

**Concept Consistency Validation**:
```bash
# Check for terminology consistency
grep -n -E '\b(validate|validation|validator)\b' [target_file] | head -10

# Identify potential semantic conflicts
grep -n -E '\b(should|must|shall|will|can|may)\b' [target_file] | head -10

# Check for definition consistency
grep -n -E '^\*\*.*\*\*:' [target_file]
```

**Semantic Coherence Scoring**:
```yaml
semantic_scoring_formula:
  concept_consistency_score: assessment(terminology_uniform) * 40
  logical_flow_score: assessment(progression_rational) * 35
  contradiction_detection_score: assessment(conflicts_identified) * 25
  total_semantic_score: sum(above_components) # max 100
```

### Phase 3: Procedural Analysis

**Workflow Validation**:
```bash
# Check step sequencing
grep -n -E '^(Step|Phase)\s+\d+' [target_file]

# Validate procedural consistency
grep -n -E '\b(then|next|after|before|following)\b' [target_file] | head -10

# Check error handling integration
grep -n -E '\b(error|failure|exception|fallback)\b' [target_file] | wc -l
```

**Procedural Coherence Scoring**:
```yaml
procedural_scoring_formula:
  workflow_consistency_score: assessment(step_sequence_logical) * 45
  step_alignment_score: assessment(dependency_satisfaction) * 35
  process_validation_score: assessment(error_handling_integrated) * 20
  total_procedural_score: sum(above_components) # max 100
```

### Phase 4: Terminological Analysis

**Terminology Consistency Check**:
```bash
# Identify key terms used
grep -o -E '\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\b' [target_file] | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20

# Check for definition patterns
grep -n -E '^\*\*.*\*\*:|^.*:\s*[A-Z]' [target_file]

# Validate technical term usage
grep -n -E '\b(AI|agent|framework|validation|assessment)\b' [target_file] | head -10
```

**Terminological Coherence Scoring**:
```yaml
terminological_scoring_formula:
  vocabulary_consistency_score: assessment(term_usage_standardized) * 50
  concept_mapping_score: assessment(definitions_clear) * 30
  conflict_resolution_score: assessment(terminology_conflicts_resolved) * 20
  total_terminological_score: sum(above_components) # max 100
```

### Phase 5: Goal Analysis

**Objective Alignment Validation**:
```bash
# Check for goal statements
grep -n -E '\b(goal|objective|purpose|aim|target)\b' [target_file]

# Validate success criteria
grep -n -E '\b(success|criteria|threshold|requirement)\b' [target_file]

# Check outcome specifications
grep -n -E '\b(outcome|result|achievement|completion)\b' [target_file]
```

**Goal Coherence Scoring**:
```yaml
goal_scoring_formula:
  objective_alignment_score: assessment(goals_consistent) * 40
  success_criteria_score: assessment(criteria_measurable) * 35
  outcome_validation_score: assessment(outcomes_verifiable) * 25
  total_goal_score: sum(above_components) # max 100
```
