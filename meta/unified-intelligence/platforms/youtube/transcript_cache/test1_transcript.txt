        This is a simulated transcript for video test1.
        
        In this video, we discuss React performance optimization techniques.
        We cover topics like useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo.
        We also explore code splitting and lazy loading strategies.
        
        Key tools mentioned: React DevTools, Lighthouse, Bundle Analyzer.
        
        The main learning outcomes include understanding when to optimize,
        measuring performance impacts, and implementing effective solutions.
