## Completed Tasks

## Task Status Key

- [ ] **Not Started** - Task identified but not yet begun
- [→] **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- [✓] **Completed** - Task finished successfully
- [!] **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to dependency or issue
- [?] **Needs Clarification** - Requires more information or decision

## Task Categories

- **Research**: Gather information, analyze existing knowledge
- **Planning**: Define scope, create roadmaps, analyze requirements  
- **Implementation**: Execute main project work
- **Validation**: Review progress, test outcomes, validate against goals
- **Documentation**: Create or update project documentation

## Notes for AI Agents

- Always check the highest priority uncompleted task first
- Update task status when you begin or complete work
- Add new tasks as you discover them during work
- Move completed tasks to the "Completed Tasks" section
- If blocked, note the reason and what's needed to unblock
