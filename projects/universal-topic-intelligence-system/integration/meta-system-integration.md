### Coordination Patterns

**Primary Integration Points**:
1. **MCP Server Discovery**: Topic system queries meta system for optimal servers
2. **Error Learning Integration**: Topic system contributes to and learns from error patterns
3. **Configuration Synchronization**: Topic-specific MCP configurations coordinate with meta system
4. **Performance Optimization**: Shared insights improve both systems
