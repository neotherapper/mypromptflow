## Implementation Recommendations

### For AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator

#### Primary RSS Processing Stack
**Recommended Architecture**:
```
Layer 1: RSS Parsing - feedparser (Python)
Layer 2: Feed Management - FreshRSS (Self-hosted)
Layer 3: Automation - Custom Python integration
Layer 4: Quality Assessment - MCP-coordinated validation
```

class RSSProcessor:
    def parse_feed(self, url):
        d = feedparser.parse(url)
        return {
            'title': d.feed.title,
            'entries': [
                {
                    'title': entry.title,
                    'link': entry.link,
                    'published': entry.published_parsed,

                }
                for entry in d.entries
            ]
        }
```

**Phase 2: Quality Assessment Integration**
```python
# MCP-coordinated content validation
class FeedQualityAssessment:
    def __init__(self, mcp_coordinator):
        self.mcp = mcp_coordinator
    
    def assess_feed_quality(self, feed_data):
        # Use Wikipedia MCP for topic validation
        # Use DuckDuckGo MCP for source credibility
