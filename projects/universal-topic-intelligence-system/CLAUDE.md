**Level 4 - Worker Agents**: Task execution specialists
- Fetch Worker Pool: Web content retrieval and processing
- GitHub Worker Pool: Repository monitoring and code analysis
- YouTube Worker Pool: Video content analysis and metadata extraction
- Social Media Worker Pool: Social media monitoring and sentiment extraction

### Quality Assessment Framework

The Universal Quality Engine provides constitutional AI-compliant quality scoring:

**Core Quality Dimensions**:
- Source Authority (25% weight): Credibility and expertise validation
- Content Accuracy (30% weight): Factual correctness and verifiability
- Relevance Alignment (20% weight): Topic scope and significance matching
- Completeness Depth (15% weight): Thoroughness and comprehensiveness
- Constitutional Compliance (10% weight): Ethical guidelines adherence

**Topic Adaptation**: Quality thresholds automatically adjust based on topic characteristics (volatility, authority distribution, information density)

### Cross-Topic Intelligence

**Relationship Detection**: Automatic identification of competitive, complementary, dependent, convergent, and influential relationships between topics
**Resource Optimization**: Intelligent sharing of sources covering multiple topics
**Pattern Recognition**: Cross-topic learning and pattern application
