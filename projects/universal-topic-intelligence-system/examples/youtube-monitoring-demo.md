# YouTube Channel Monitoring System - Live Demonstration

## System Status: RSS Limitation Discovered

### Issue Found
YouTube blocks automated RSS feed access via MCP tools due to robots.txt restrictions:
- Direct RSS feeds (`/feeds/videos.xml`) are disallowed for automated tools
- Alternative approaches needed for new video detection

### Available Solutions

#### Option 1: Manual RSS Integration (Recommended)
Since YouTube RSS feeds work in browsers and manual tools, users can:
1. **Set up RSS reader** (Feedly, Inoreader) with your 23 channel feeds
2. **Export OPML file** with all channel subscriptions  
3. **Manual check & queue** - periodically review new videos and queue URLs for transcript processing

#### Option 2: Transcript-First Approach (Immediate Value)
Focus on transcript processing for videos you discover through:
- Your regular YouTube browsing
- Manual RSS reader notifications
- Community recommendations

## Live Transcript Extraction Demo

Let me demonstrate the transcript processing capability with a programming video:

### Example: Educational Programming Content

**Video:** JavaScript Tutorial (sample)
**Channel:** Educational content similar to your subscribed channels
**Focus:** Demonstrate transcript extraction and insight generation
