## Workflow Summary

### Discovery: RSS Limitation & Solution

**Issue Found:** YouTube blocks automated RSS access via MCP tools
**Solution:** Hybrid approach combining manual discovery with automated processing

### Practical Implementation

#### Option A: Manual Video Queueing (Immediate Use)
1. **Browse your subscribed channels** normally via YouTube
2. **Queue interesting videos** by copying URLs to a processing list
3. **Run transcript extraction** using our automated pipeline
4. **Get intelligent insights** stored in your knowledge vault

#### Option B: RSS Reader Integration (Recommended)  
1. **Set up RSS reader** (Feedly, Inoreader) with your 23 channel feeds
2. **Get notifications** when channels post new videos
3. **Queue relevant videos** for processing
4. **Automated transcript analysis** provides structured insights

## Technical Implementation

### MCP Tool Integration
```python
# Core processing workflow
def process_youtube_video(video_url):
    # 1. Extract transcript
    transcript = mcp__MCP_DOCKER__get_transcript(url=video_url)
    
    # 2. Analyze content  
    insights = analyze_programming_content(transcript)
    
    # 3. Store in knowledge vault
    save_to_knowledge_vault(video_url, transcript, insights)
    
    # 4. Update topic intelligence
    update_cross_topic_connections(insights)
```
