# Universal Topic Intelligence System - User Guide

## Getting Started

The Universal Topic Intelligence System provides intelligent monitoring for any topic you care about. This guide shows you how to interact with the system and make the most of its capabilities.

## Understanding Your Topic Intelligence

### What Gets Monitored

When you deploy topic monitoring, the system automatically tracks:

**Official Sources (Tier 1)**:
- Company blogs and announcement pages
- Government agency updates and policy changes
- Academic institution research and publications
- Official project documentation and release notes

**Community Sources (Tier 2)**:
- Expert blogs and analysis sites

### How Information Is Processed

The system uses a 4-level AI hierarchy to ensure quality:

1. **Worker Agents** collect raw information from sources
2. **Specialist Agents** analyze content for accuracy and significance
3. **Architect Agents** coordinate strategy and resource allocation
4. **Queen Agent** orchestrates everything and manages priorities

Each piece of information goes through quality assessment covering authority, accuracy, relevance, completeness, and ethical compliance.

## Working with Intelligence Output

### Understanding Quality Scores

Each piece of information includes quality scores:

**Authority Score (0.0-1.0)**: Source credibility and expertise level
**Relevance Score (0.0-1.0)**: How well content matches your topic
**Significance Score (0.0-1.0)**: Importance within your topic domain
**Overall Quality (0.0-1.0)**: Combined assessment using Constitutional AI

**Interpreting Scores**:
- 0.8-1.0: High quality, actionable intelligence
- 0.6-0.8: Good quality, worth reviewing
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate quality, context-dependent value
- Below 0.4: Low quality, filtered out automatically

### Content Organization

### Making Sense of Cross-Topic Intelligence

When topics relate to each other, the system identifies:

**Competitive Relationships**: Topics that compete for attention or resources
**Complementary Relationships**: Topics that enhance each other's value
**Dependent Relationships**: Topics with dependency chains
**Convergent Relationships**: Topics that are merging or combining
**Influential Relationships**: Topics that influence each other's direction

This helps you understand the broader context of developments in your area of interest.

## Customizing Your Intelligence

### Adjusting Monitoring Frequency

**Real-time**: For breaking news and critical developments
**Hourly**: For active topics with frequent updates
**Daily**: For steady topics with regular but not urgent updates
**Weekly**: For slow-moving topics or background monitoring

### Focusing Your Intelligence

**High Priority Sources**: Official announcements, major publications
**Medium Priority Sources**: Expert analysis, industry news
**Low Priority Sources**: Community discussions, background trends

**Keyword Optimization**:
- Primary keywords get highest relevance weight
- Secondary keywords provide context
- Exclusion keywords filter out noise and irrelevant content

### Quality Threshold Adjustment

**Conservative**: Higher thresholds, less noise, might miss some developments
**Balanced**: Standard thresholds, good signal-to-noise ratio
**Comprehensive**: Lower thresholds, maximum coverage, more noise to filter

## Getting the Most Value

### Daily Workflow Recommendations

**Morning Briefing (10 minutes)**:
1. Review overnight Tier 1 developments for breaking news
2. Scan Tier 2 analysis for expert insights
3. Check weekly digest for broader trends

**Deep Dive Sessions (30-60 minutes)**:
1. Read full analysis reports for significant developments
2. Explore source profiles for new or changing authorities
3. Review cross-topic relationships for broader implications

### Weekly Review Process

**Performance Assessment**:
- Review coverage: Are we catching the important developments?
- Check relevance: Is the content matching your interests?
- Evaluate quality: Are the insights valuable and actionable?

**System Optimization**:
- Suggest new sources if gaps are identified
- Adjust keyword focus based on content patterns
- Refine quality thresholds based on value received

### Integration with Your Workflow

**Research and Analysis**:
- Use daily briefings for situational awareness
