# Usage Guidelines and Best Practices
usage_guidelines:
  file_creation_workflow:
    1: "Determine appropriate directory based on content type"

    4: "Populate all required metadata fields"
    5: "Establish appropriate cross-references"
    6: "Validate file integrity before saving"
    
  organization_best_practices:
    - "Keep directory structure shallow (max 3-4 levels deep)"
    - "Use descriptive filenames that indicate content without reading"
    - "Maintain consistent metadata across all files"
    - "Regularly review and cleanup outdated content"
    - "Establish clear ownership and update responsibilities"
    
  common_pitfalls:
    - "Creating ad-hoc directory structures without planning"
    - "Inconsistent naming conventions across topics"
    - "Missing or incomplete metadata"
    - "Broken cross-references due to file moves"
    - "Ignoring retention policies leading to storage bloat"
    
  optimization_opportunities:
    - "Regular analysis of access patterns for cache optimization"
    - "Identification of frequently cross-referenced content"
    - "Consolidation of related content for improved organization"
    - "Automation of repetitive file creation and organization tasks"
