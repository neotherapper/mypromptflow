## AI Agent Instructions

### How to Work on This Project

1. **Read Context First**: Review project-purpose.md for detailed goals and comprehensive scope
2. **Check Tasks**: Look at task-list.md for current priorities, dependencies, and success metrics
3. **Review Research**: Check research-integration.md for leveraged research findings and application strategies
4. **Use Progressive Documentation**: Apply progressive context loading achieving 60-70% token reduction
5. **Update Progress**: Document your work in progress.md with specific accomplishments and outcomes
6. **Manage Tasks**: Update task-list.md when completing or adding tasks, maintaining dependency tracking

### Core Working Patterns

**Preferred Approach**: 
- **Apply Research Findings**: Use comprehensive research from 3 domains (PR validation, file recognition, CI/CD integration) 
- **Follow Validated Framework**: Apply 93% effective AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence framework for all agent instructions
- **Use Parallel Development**: Spawn subagents for faster development while maintaining quality standards
- **Focus on Conditional Logic**: Implement intelligent file pattern recognition and conditional agent spawning
- **Optimize for Performance**: Achieve 60-70% token reduction while maintaining comprehensive validation coverage

**Quality Standards**: 
- **Framework Compliance**: All agent instructions must achieve >90% effectiveness scores using validated assessment tools
- **Constitutional AI Compliance**: 99% compliance required across all automated operations with ethical validation
- **Research Integration**: All implementation decisions must reference and apply research findings appropriately
- **Self-Sufficiency**: Instructions must be self-contained and immediately actionable without external dependencies
- **Performance Optimization**: Token optimization and sub-5-minute validation targets must be achieved

**Things to Avoid**: 
- Creating agent instructions without applying the validated 93% effective framework patterns
- Implementing file detection without leveraging file pattern recognition research findings
- Building validation logic without referencing PR validation systems research
- Creating components that don't integrate with the existing research orchestrator framework

### Understanding Claude Commands and AI Agent Orchestration

### Conditional File Detection and Agent Spawning

**File Pattern Recognition Implementation:**
Based on comprehensive research findings in `@research/findings/file-pattern-recognition-systems/`, implement:

**Multi-Layered Detection Architecture:**
```yaml
detection_layers:
  layer_1_extension:
    pattern_matching: "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,md,yaml,json}"
    confidence_base: 0.6
    
  layer_2_content:
    magic_numbers: "AST parsing, file headers, syntax detection"
    confidence_boost: 0.3
    
  layer_3_context:
    directory_structure: "src/, tests/, docs/, .claude/"
    dependency_analysis: "package.json, requirements.txt"
    confidence_boost: 0.1
```

**Conditional Agent Spawning Logic:**
```yaml
spawning_conditions:
  claude_commands:
    file_pattern: ".claude/commands/*.md"
    content_validation: "Command structure verification"
    agent: "claude-command-evaluator"
    instructions: "@meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/claude-command-evaluator.md"
    parallel_safe: true
    
  typescript_frontend:
    file_pattern: "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
    context_check: "React/frontend dependencies in package.json"
    agent: "typescript-frontend-validator"  
    instructions: "@meta/validation/validators/file-type/typescript-frontend-validator.md"
    parallel_safe: true
    depends_on: ["security-validator"]
    
  python_backend:
    file_pattern: "**/*.py"
    context_check: "API/backend patterns in imports"
    agent: "python-backend-validator"
    instructions: "@meta/validation/validators/file-type/python-backend-validator.md" 
    parallel_safe: true
    depends_on: ["security-validator"]
    
  test_files:
    file_pattern: "**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,py}"
    agent: "test-validator"
    instructions: "@meta/validation/validators/file-type/test-validator.md"
    parallel_safe: false
    depends_on: ["typescript-frontend-validator", "python-backend-validator"]
```

**Agent Spawning Decision Tree:**
1. **Parse PR File List**: Use GitHub API to get complete file change list
2. **Apply Pattern Recognition**: Use multi-layered detection for file classification
3. **Determine Dependencies**: Analyze validation dependencies for sequential vs parallel execution
4. **Spawn Parallel Agents**: Launch independent validations simultaneously for efficiency
5. **Coordinate Sequential Validations**: Execute dependent validations in proper order
6. **Aggregate Results**: Combine all validation outputs into comprehensive report

### Self-Updating Agent Instruction System

**Master Instruction Updater Framework:**
Create `@meta/validation/validators/project/master-instruction-updater.md` with:

**Registry Management:**
```yaml
agent_instruction_registry:
  claude-command-evaluator:
    path: "@meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/claude-command-evaluator.md"
    purpose: "Evaluate Claude command files for structure and quality"
    framework_version: "1.0"
    last_updated: "2025-07-19"
    effectiveness_score: "pending"
    
  typescript-frontend-validator:
    path: "@meta/validation/validators/file-type/typescript-frontend-validator.md" 
    purpose: "Frontend-specific TypeScript validation"
    framework_version: "1.0"
    last_updated: "2025-07-19"
    effectiveness_score: "pending"
```

**Update Procedures:**
1. **Research Integration**: Monitor research registry for new relevant findings
2. **Framework Evolution**: Track AI agent instruction framework improvements
3. **Performance Assessment**: Regular effectiveness scoring using validated assessment tools
4. **Instruction Updates**: Apply new research findings to improve agent instructions
5. **Quality Validation**: Ensure all updates maintain >90% effectiveness scores

### Progressive Context Loading Implementation

**Context Optimization Strategy** (60-70% Token Reduction):
Based on validated framework research in `@projects/ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/`:

**Base Context Loading (400 lines):**
```yaml
base_context:
  - project_purpose: "Core goals and success criteria"
  - validation_framework: "Multi-dimensional validation approach"
  - quality_standards: "Constitutional AI compliance and effectiveness targets"
  - performance_targets: "Sub-5-minute validation with accuracy requirements"
```

**Conditional Context Loading (200-600 lines per agent):**
```yaml
conditional_context:
  typescript_frontend:
    load_if: "TypeScript files detected"
    context_files: ["frontend-validation-patterns.md", "react-specific-checks.md"]
    token_count: 450
    
  python_backend:
    load_if: "Python files detected"  
    context_files: ["backend-validation-patterns.md", "api-security-checks.md"]
    token_count: 520
    
  claude_commands:
    load_if: ".claude/commands/*.md files detected"
    context_files: ["command-structure-validation.md", "claude-specific-patterns.md"] 
    token_count: 380
```

**Progressive Loading Implementation:**
1. **Load Base Context**: Always load core validation framework (400 lines)
2. **Detect File Types**: Use conditional detection to identify required contexts
3. **Load Specific Contexts**: Load only relevant validation contexts based on PR files
4. **Optimize Shared Context**: Use context pools for related validations to avoid duplication
5. **Monitor Token Usage**: Track and optimize for 60-70% reduction targets

### Quality Validation and Framework Compliance

**Constitutional AI Integration:**
- **Principle Definition**: Accuracy, completeness, consistency, ethical compliance for all validation operations
