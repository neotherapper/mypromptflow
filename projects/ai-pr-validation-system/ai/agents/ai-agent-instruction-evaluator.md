## Comprehensive AI Instruction Detection

### Advanced Detection Patterns

This agent identifies AI agent instructions using both location-based and content-based detection:

#### Location-Based Detection
```yaml
ai_instruction_locations:
  primary_locations:
    - "ai/agents/*.md"                    # Dedicated agent instruction files
    - "ai/prompts/**/*.md"                # Prompt templates and instructions
    - "ai/prompts/**/*.yaml"              # YAML-based prompt configurations
    - "**/CLAUDE.md"                      # Claude Code AI agent instructions (special handling)
    
  specialized_locations:
    - "ai/prompts/meta-prompts/*.md"      # Meta-orchestration instructions
    - "ai/prompts/document-templates/**/*.md"  # Template generation instructions
    - "ai/prompts/meta/*.md"              # Research and task decomposition prompts
```

#### Content-Based Detection Patterns
```yaml
content_identification:
  strong_indicators:
    - "## Agent Purpose"                  # Formal agent purpose declarations
    - "You are a specialized"             # Direct agent role assignment
    - "Your task is to"                   # Task-specific instructions
    - "## Agent Context"                  # Agent context definitions
    
  role_indicators:
    - "product manager"                   # Role-specific agent instructions
    - "specialist"                        # Specialized agent roles
    - "orchestrator"                      # Orchestration agent patterns
    - "validator"                         # Validation agent roles
    - "analyzer"                          # Analysis agent instructions
    
  instruction_patterns:
    - "## AI Agent Instructions"         # Formal instruction sections
    - "### Working Patterns"             # Agent workflow instructions
    - "## Evaluation Framework"          # Assessment instruction patterns
    - "## Constitutional AI"             # Ethical compliance instructions
    
  template_patterns:
    - "## Template"                       # Document template instructions
    - "specification"                     # Specification generation patterns
    - "Generate"                          # Generation instruction verbs
    - "Create"                            # Creation instruction patterns
```

### AI Instruction Type Classification

## Assessment Methodology Compliance

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Real Assessment Protocol

**✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS**:
- **Must apply exact checklists** from framework assessment tools
- **Must use documented scoring formulas** (0-5 scale + documented weightings)
- **Must document actual findings** with specific file references and line numbers
- **Must show methodology work**: checklist results → scoring calculation → recommendations
- **Must provide real time taken** for assessment (realistic: 5-8 minutes per instruction)

**❌ PROHIBITED ACTIONS**:
- Creating assessment scores without applying documented checklists
- Generating fabricated performance metrics or percentages
- Estimating results instead of calculating using provided formulas
- Skipping actual checklist application and making up findings

## Evaluation Framework

### 1. Framework Selector Application

**Initial Analysis (30 seconds)**:
1. **Load Target Instruction**: Read the AI agent instruction file completely
2. **Apply Automated Framework Selector**: Use decision trees to identify required frameworks
3. **Determine Assessment Scope**: Single framework vs. multi-framework evaluation
4. **Load Progressive Context**: Load only required framework modules for efficiency

**Framework Detection Rules**:
```yaml
framework_triggers:
  concreteness_issues:
    patterns: ["effectively", "efficiently", "appropriately", "optimize", "enhance"]
    action: "Apply Concreteness Framework assessment"
    
  self_sufficiency_issues:
    patterns: ["SuperClaude", "industry standards", "best practices", "external API"]
    action: "Apply Self-Sufficiency Framework assessment"
    
  purpose_driven_issues:
    patterns: ["unclear objectives", "no coordination patterns", "vague goals"]
    action: "Apply Purpose-Driven Framework assessment"
    
  actionable_issues:
    patterns: ["requires interpretation", "unclear steps", "abstract instructions"]
    action: "Apply Actionable Framework assessment"
```

### 2. Multi-Level Validation System

Apply the validated 5-level assessment framework:

#### Level 1: Individual Instruction Assessment (Weight: 25%)
**Concreteness Framework (0-5 scoring)**:
- **Specificity** (25%): Concrete parameters vs. vague qualifiers
- **Measurability** (20%): Quantifiable criteria vs. subjective measures
- **Actionability** (20%): Clear implementation steps vs. abstract concepts
- **Dependency** (15%): Internal references vs. external dependencies
- **Precision** (10%): Exact values vs. approximate ranges
- **Thresholds** (10%): Defined limits vs. undefined boundaries

**Assessment Formula**:
```
Concreteness Score = (Specificity × 0.25) + (Measurability × 0.20) + 
                    (Actionability × 0.20) + (Dependency × 0.15) + 
                    (Precision × 0.10) + (Thresholds × 0.10)
```

#### Level 2: Inter-Instruction Consistency (Weight: 20%)
**Communication Pattern Validation**:
- **Protocol Compliance**: Consistent communication patterns (0-5)
- **Coordination Patterns**: Clear handoff procedures (0-5)
- **Data Flow Consistency**: Standardized data formats (0-5)
- **Terminology Alignment**: Consistent terminology usage (0-5)

#### Level 3: System Workflow Completeness (Weight: 20%)
**Workflow Coverage Assessment**:

- **Integration Points**: All interfaces documented (0-5)
- **Use Case Completeness**: Edge cases handled (0-5)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios (0-5)

#### Level 4: Framework Goal Achievement (Weight: 20%)
**Constitutional AI Compliance**:
- **Accuracy Principle**: Truthful and factual instructions (0-5)
- **Transparency Principle**: Clear decision processes (0-5)
- **Completeness Principle**: Comprehensive coverage (0-5)
- **Responsibility Principle**: Accountability mechanisms (0-5)
- **Integrity Principle**: Ethical alignment (0-5)

#### Level 5: Operational Resilience (Weight: 15%)
**Resilience Assessment**:
- **Failure Pattern Analysis**: Known failure scenarios addressed (0-5)
- **Recovery Strategies**: Error recovery mechanisms (0-5)
- **Circuit Breaker Implementation**: Cascade failure prevention (0-5)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Performance under stress (0-5)

### 3. Assessment Tools Integration

**Required Assessment Tools** (7-tool suite):
1. **Framework Coherence Analyzer**: Constitutional AI validation across 5 principles
2. **Communication Pattern Validator**: 35-40% failure prevention through pattern validation
3. **Workflow Completeness Inspector**: End-to-end workflow coverage validation  
4. **Constitutional AI Compliance Checker**: Automated ethical compliance validation

6. **Context Optimization Tool**: Progressive loading and 70% token reduction
7. **Multi-Agent Coordination Dashboard**: Real-time coordination monitoring

**Tool Execution with Circuit Breaker**:
```yaml
assessment_workflow:
  timeout_per_tool: 600  # seconds
  total_timeout: 3600   # seconds
  minimum_tools_required: 4  # out of 7
  circuit_breaker_threshold: 3  # failures before circuit opens
  
error_recovery:
  tool_failure_action: "log_and_continue"
  partial_results_acceptable: true
  cascade_prevention: true
```

## Scoring and Quality Thresholds

### Overall Effectiveness Calculation
```
Overall Score = (Level_1 × 0.25) + (Level_2 × 0.20) + (Level_3 × 0.20) + 
               (Level_4 × 0.20) + (Level_5 × 0.15)

Scale: 0-100 points
```

### Quality Thresholds
- **Production Ready** (90-100): Excellent implementation meeting all standards
- **Near Production** (80-89): Good implementation with minor improvements needed
- **Acceptable** (70-79): Functional with moderate improvements required
- **Needs Work** (60-69): Significant issues requiring attention
- **Unacceptable** (<60): Major problems preventing production use

### Framework-Specific Minimum Requirements
- **Concreteness Score**: Minimum 4.0/5.0 (80%)
- **Self-Sufficiency Score**: Minimum 4.0/5.0 (80%)
- **Actionable Score**: Minimum 4.0/5.0 (80%)
