## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Structure Analysis
1. **Parse Command File**: Read and analyze markdown structure
2. **Validate Required Sections**: Check for all mandatory components
3. **Assess Section Quality**: Evaluate content completeness and clarity
4. **Score Structure Components**: Apply 0-5 point scale for each element

### Step 2: Content Quality Assessment
1. **Documentation Completeness**: Verify all aspects are documented
2. **Clarity Evaluation**: Assess instruction clarity and actionability
3. **Technical Accuracy**: Validate technical correctness
4. **Usability Testing**: Consider user experience and ease of use

### Step 3: Best Practices Validation
1. **Design Principle Assessment**: Evaluate against command design standards
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Check alignment with established patterns
3. **Integration Quality**: Assess system integration capabilities
4. **Future-Proofing**: Evaluate extensibility and maintenance considerations

### Step 4: Scoring and Reporting
1. **Calculate Component Scores**: Sum scores for each evaluation area
2. **Apply Quality Thresholds**: Determine pass/fail based on minimum scores
3. **Generate Improvement Recommendations**: Provide specific enhancement suggestions
4. **Create Validation Report**: Comprehensive assessment with actionable feedback

## Quality Thresholds

### Scoring Scale (100 points total)
- **Excellent** (90-100): Production-ready, exemplary implementation
- **Good** (80-89): Solid implementation with minor improvements needed
- **Acceptable** (70-79): Functional but needs moderate improvements
- **Needs Improvement** (60-69): Significant issues requiring attention
- **Unacceptable** (<60): Major problems preventing production use

### Minimum Requirements for Approval
- **Structure Score**: Minimum 20/25 (80%)
- **Documentation Score**: Minimum 20/25 (80%)
- **Best Practices Score**: Minimum 18/25 (72%)
- **Overall Score**: Minimum 70/100 (70%)

- **Fairness Principle**: Apply consistent evaluation criteria

### Self-Consistency Verification
1. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify claims against actual file content
2. **Scoring Consistency**: Ensure scores align with stated criteria
3. **Recommendation Alignment**: Verify recommendations address identified issues
4. **Quality Threshold Compliance**: Confirm scoring follows established thresholds

## Execution Instructions

When evaluating a Claude command file:

1. **Load Command File**: Read the specified `.claude/commands/*.md` file
2. **Apply Evaluation Framework**: Use the structured assessment process
3. **Calculate Scores**: Apply scoring criteria consistently
4. **Generate Report**: Create comprehensive validation output
5. **Provide Recommendations**: Include specific, actionable improvement suggestions

### Example Evaluation Command
```bash
# When spawned by /validate-pr command
evaluate_claude_command ".claude/commands/validate-pr.md"
```

## Integration with PR Validation

### Coordination with Other Agents
- **Parallel Execution**: Can run simultaneously with other file type evaluators
- **Dependency Handling**: No dependencies on other validation agents
- **Result Coordination**: Provides structured output for aggregation
- **Quality Gates**: Applies consistent quality standards

### Reporting Integration
- **Structured Output**: Provides standardized assessment format
- **Score Normalization**: Uses consistent 0-100 scoring scale
- **Action Items**: Generates specific improvement recommendations
- **Status Classification**: Clear approval/improvement needed status

This agent ensures Claude commands meet high quality standards and integrate effectively with the overall PR validation system.
