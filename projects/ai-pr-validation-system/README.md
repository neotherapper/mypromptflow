# AI PR Validation System

An intelligent Pull Request validation system that leverages AI agent orchestration for comprehensive, automated code review and validation with conditional file-type detection and specialized agent spawning.

## Quick Start

### For AI Agents
1. **Read Project Context**: Start with `project-purpose.md` for comprehensive goals and scope
2. **Check Current Tasks**: Review `task-list.md` for prioritized work queue and dependencies  
3. **Review Research**: Check `research-integration.md` for leveraged research findings
4. **Track Progress**: Document work in `progress.md`
5. **Apply Framework**: Use validated 93% effective AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence framework

### For Developers
```bash
# Future usage (after implementation)
/validate-pr 123  # Validate PR #123 with intelligent agent orchestration
```

## Project Overview

This system creates intelligent PR validation through:

- **Conditional File Detection**: Advanced pattern matching spawns appropriate specialized agents based on file types
- **AI Agent Orchestration**: 4-level hierarchy (Queen â†’ Architect â†’ Specialist â†’ Worker) for optimal validation coverage
- **Research-Driven Quality**: Applies validated 93% effective framework achieving enterprise-grade performance
- **Self-Updating System**: Master instruction updater enables continuous improvement of agent capabilities

## Architecture

### Conditional Agent Spawning
```yaml
File Types â†’ Specialized Agents:
  .claude/commands/*.md â†’ claude-command-evaluator
  src/**/*.{ts,tsx} â†’ typescript-frontend-validator  
  **/*.py â†’ python-backend-validator
  **/*.{test,spec}.* â†’ test-validator
  docs/**/*.md â†’ documentation-validator
