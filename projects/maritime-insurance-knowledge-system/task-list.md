## Upcoming Validation Questions

Based on OneDrive file analysis, these questions will need user validation:

### Business Model Questions
- "Based on the OneDrive files, is the VanguardAI platform B2C or B2B?" (Expected: B2C - confirmed by user)
- "Does the platform serve individual vessel owners or corporate fleets?" (Needs validation)
- "What is the primary customer segment for maritime insurance?" (Needs validation)

### Risk Assessment Questions
- "Should war risk calculations include vessel tonnage as a primary factor?" (Needs validation)
- "Are the voyage risk models in the premium examples current?" (Needs validation)
- "What are the key factors for static vessel risk assessment?" (Needs validation)

### Regulatory Questions
- "Are the sanction screening procedures in the HH questionnaire current?" (Needs validation)
- "What KYC requirements apply to B2C maritime insurance customers?" (Needs validation)
- "Which regulatory frameworks govern maritime insurance operations?" (Needs validation)

### Operational Questions
- "What are the standard steps in the quote generation workflow?" (Needs validation)
- "How does customer onboarding work for B2C maritime insurance?" (Needs validation)
- "What vessel data is required for insurance applications?" (Needs validation)

## Task Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
1. Maritime commands → Knowledge extraction → User validation → Integration
2. OneDrive analysis → Agent deployment → Knowledge processing → Validation questions
3. Validation system → User sessions → Approved knowledge → Agent training

### Parallel Opportunities
1. Command creation can happen alongside OneDrive analysis
2. Agent specialization can occur during validation system development
3. Different knowledge categories can be processed simultaneously

## Risk Mitigation Tasks

### High-Risk Mitigation
- [ ] **Implement timestamp tracking** for all OneDrive files
- [ ] **Create conflict resolution process** for contradictory information
- [ ] **Design rollback procedures** for incorrect validations
- [ ] **Establish knowledge confidence scoring** system

### Medium-Risk Mitigation
- [ ] **Create backup validation procedures** in case of user unavailability
- [ ] **Implement incremental validation** to avoid bottlenecks
- [ ] **Design knowledge versioning** system for updates
- [ ] **Create validation quality metrics** for continuous improvement

## Success Metrics

### Completion Metrics
- [ ] **Knowledge Coverage**: 100% of OneDrive files processed
- [ ] **Validation Rate**: >90% of extracted knowledge approved
- [ ] **Response Time**: <24 hours from question to user validation
- [ ] **System Integration**: All @ai/ commands working with maritime knowledge

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] **Accuracy**: Validated knowledge matches business requirements
- [ ] **Completeness**: All critical maritime insurance areas covered
- [ ] **Consistency**: No contradictions in approved knowledge base
- [ ] **Usability**: AI agents provide accurate maritime domain responses

## Notes

- User confirmed B2C platform focus - update all documentation accordingly
- OneDrive files may contain outdated information - prioritize timestamp checking
- Focus on systematic validation rather than comprehensive initial extraction
- Maintain clear separation between pending and approved knowledge throughout process
