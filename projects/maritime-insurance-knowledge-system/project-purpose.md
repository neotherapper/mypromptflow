# Maritime Insurance Knowledge System - Project Purpose

## Project Overview

This project creates a comprehensive AI-powered knowledge base for maritime insurance, specifically focused on the VanguardAI maritime risk platform. The system processes business documentation from OneDrive, validates knowledge through user interaction, and provides intelligent maritime insurance domain expertise to AI agents.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Knowledge Extraction**: Systematically extract and structure maritime insurance knowledge from OneDrive source files
2. **User Validation**: Create an interactive validation system where users approve critical knowledge before it's marked as authoritative
3. **AI Agent Specialization**: Build AI agents with deep maritime insurance domain expertise
4. **System Integration**: Integrate with existing @ai/ system for comprehensive business intelligence

### Secondary Goals

1. **Documentation Quality**: Maintain high-quality, structured documentation following existing project standards
2. **Audit Trail**: Create complete traceability for all knowledge validation decisions
3. **Scalability**: Design system to handle future expansion to other insurance domains
4. **User Experience**: Make knowledge validation process intuitive and efficient

- [ ] Create maritime-specific agent workflows
- [ ] Test end-to-end knowledge retrieval
- [ ] Documentation and training materials

## Approach and Methodology

### Knowledge Processing Approach

1. **Systematic File Analysis**: Process OneDrive files categorically (risk assessment, regulatory, operational, business)
2. **Specialized Agent Deployment**: Use domain-specific agents for different knowledge areas
3. **Structured Extraction**: Convert unstructured documents into structured markdown/yaml
4. **Validation-First Process**: No knowledge approved without user validation

### User Validation Methodology

1. **Question Generation**: Create specific, contextual questions for each extracted fact
2. **Interactive Approval**: Present questions to user with source context
3. **Response Processing**: Handle approval, correction, and rejection responses
4. **Knowledge Storage**: Maintain clear separation between pending and approved knowledge

### Quality Assurance Framework

1. **Source Tracking**: Every piece of knowledge linked to source file and timestamp
2. **Confidence Scoring**: AI assigns confidence levels to extracted information
3. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure consistency across related knowledge areas
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of validation decisions and reasoning

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **No Code/Database Files**: System must use only markdown and yaml files
- **OneDrive File Limitations**: Some files may be outdated or contain conflicting information
- **Integration Requirements**: Must work with existing @ai/ system without disruption
- **User Availability**: Validation process requires user time and domain expertise

### Business Constraints

- **Domain Specificity**: Focus specifically on maritime insurance, not general insurance
- **B2C Platform Focus**: Confirmed by user as B2C platform, not B2B
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Must accurately reflect current maritime insurance regulations
- **Risk Assessment Accuracy**: Risk calculation models must be precise and validated

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Outdated Information**: OneDrive files may contain outdated procedures or regulations
   - **Mitigation**: Timestamp tracking and user validation of currency
   
2. **Knowledge Conflicts**: Different files may contain contradictory information
   - **Mitigation**: Present conflicts to user for resolution during validation
   
3. **Domain Complexity**: Maritime insurance involves complex regulatory and risk factors
   - **Mitigation**: Specialized agents and comprehensive user validation

4. **User Validation Bottleneck**: Process depends on user availability for approvals
   - **Mitigation**: Batch validation sessions and clear prioritization

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **System Integration**: Potential conflicts with existing @ai/ system
   - **Mitigation**: Careful testing and isolated development approach
   
2. **Knowledge Completeness**: May miss critical information in OneDrive files
   - **Mitigation**: Systematic file processing and user review of completeness

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Outcomes (Phase 1-2)

- Complete inventory of maritime insurance knowledge from OneDrive
- Structured validation questions for all critical facts
- Initial maritime agent specialization
- Foundation for ongoing knowledge management

### Medium-term Outcomes (Phase 3-4)

- Fully validated maritime insurance knowledge base
- Integrated AI agents with maritime domain expertise
- Functional validation system for ongoing knowledge updates
- Enhanced @ai/ system with maritime capabilities

### Long-term Outcomes (Post-Project)

- Scalable framework for other insurance domains
- Continuous knowledge validation and updates
- Enhanced development velocity for maritime platform
- Comprehensive business intelligence system

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources

- **Domain Expert**: User validation and knowledge approval (estimated 8-10 hours)
- **AI Agent Orchestration**: Systematic knowledge extraction and processing
- **Integration Specialist**: @ai/ system integration and testing

### Technical Resources

- **OneDrive Access**: Full access to maritime insurance project files
- **Git Worktree**: Isolated development environment
