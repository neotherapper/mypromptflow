Coverage

Add-ons

What are the rules of adding additional coverages when war coverage is selected for a voyage? When we add "War H&M", "War Loss of Hire", "K&R"?. Any business rules to be included in the platform or just selection by customer?

Decision choices: - A. Always-mandatory: When War coverage is selected, automatically include War H&M, War LoH, and K&R with no option to deselect. - B. Suggested-only: System suggests add-ons but allows the customer to deselect any non-mandatory items. - C. Territory-specific rules: Admins maintain a table mapping each HRA to required add-ons.

Any proposal to the customer to provide similar coverage that is applicable for war?

How days of coverage are defined(7 days, 14 days). Are these per HRA?

Should user override the duration in the request?

Broker

In which step of quote creation process customer selects broker? Initial? Or at submit when he has all available information? Could we have anything in the quote creation process dependent on the selected broker?

Should we choose broker in the journey? (on the basis that we only show the best deal per region.)

Does every broker have unique rate per region?

Why let customer decide broker if we know the best deal?

Can we have multiple brokers per quote when multiple HRA exist?

Or we should create two separate quotes?

Quote acceptance

What are the actions just before and after expiration?

A) which notification settings should we establish?

Propose to be a setting on broker.

B) Ship broker independent

Ship broker quotes should be restricted to only vessels that manages?

Should the ship owner be notified as well? Keep it simple for vpn No?
