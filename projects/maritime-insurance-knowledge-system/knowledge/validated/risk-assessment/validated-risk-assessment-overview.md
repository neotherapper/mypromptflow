- No immediate updates required to vessel type categories
- Solid foundation for premium calculations

---

## Validation Statistics

**Total Facts Validated**: 4  
**Overall Validation Success Rate**: 100%  
**Average Confidence Level**: 92.5%

**Approval Breakdown**:
- Approved as stated: 2 facts (50%)
- Approved with modifications: 2 facts (50%)
- Rejected: 0 facts (0%)

## Key Business Logic Extracted

### 1. Tonnage-Based Risk Assessment
- Vessel tonnage is the primary factor in war risk calculations
- Larger vessels = higher financial exposure
- Tonnage data accuracy is critical for proper risk assessment

### 2. Dynamic Risk Environment
- Port risk ratings change based on geopolitical circumstances
- Monthly updates required from underwriters
- System should prompt users for regular updates

### 3. Seasonal Risk Modeling
- Voyage risk models incorporate seasonal variations
- Users must actively request updated rates
- Historical seasonal data combined with current market rates

### 4. Stable Classification System
- Current vessel type classifications are market-appropriate
- No immediate system updates required
- Reliable foundation for automated risk systems

## Implementation Guidelines for AI Agents

### Critical Requirements
1. **Monthly Port Risk Updates**: Prompt users to contact underwriters monthly
2. **Regular Voyage Rate Updates**: Remind users to request current rates
3. **Tonnage Validation**: Ensure accurate tonnage data before war risk calculations
4. **Classification Reliability**: Use current vessel type classifications confidently

### System Integration Points
- War risk calculations ↔ Vessel tonnage factors
- Port risk ratings ↔ Dynamic update requirements
- Voyage risk models ↔ Seasonal factors + current rates
- Vessel classifications ↔ Risk profile assignments

### Quality Assurance
- All validated knowledge has confidence levels ≥90%
- User-approved modifications incorporated
- Business logic extracted and documented
- Ready for AI agent implementation

## Risk Assessment Workflow

```
1. Vessel Assessment
   ├── Verify vessel type classification (✅ Current)
   ├── Validate tonnage data (✅ Primary factor)
   └── Assign baseline risk profile

2. Route Assessment
   ├── Check port risk ratings (⚠️ Monthly updates needed)
   ├── Apply seasonal voyage factors (⚠️ Rate updates needed)
   └── Calculate route-specific risks

3. War Risk Evaluation
   ├── Apply tonnage-based calculations (✅ Primary factor)
   ├── Consider port security status
   └── Generate war risk premium

4. Final Risk Assessment
   ├── Combine all risk factors
   ├── Apply validated business logic
   └── Generate final premium calculation
```
