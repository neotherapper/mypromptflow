## Overview
This document contains user-validated information about sanction screening procedures for the VanguardAI maritime insurance platform.

## Sanction Questionnaire Framework

### Unified Questionnaire Approach
- **Validated Fact**: All customers see the same sanction questionnaire, though the questionnaire may change in the future (not often)
- **Confidence Level**: 95%
- **Validated By**: User on 2025-01-17
- **Source**: User validation session
- **Validation Response**: B (Approved with modifications)

### Key Implementation Points
1. **Consistency**: All customers receive identical sanction screening questionnaires
2. **Standardization**: No differentiation between customer types for sanction screening
3. **Future Updates**: Questionnaire may change but changes are infrequent
4. **Predictability**: Changes are not expected to be frequent, providing stability

### Business Logic
- Single questionnaire reduces complexity in compliance processes
- Unified approach ensures consistent compliance standards
- Infrequent changes provide operational stability
- All customer types (B2C, Corporate) use same screening process

### Implementation Considerations
- Design single questionnaire interface for all customer types
- Plan for infrequent but possible questionnaire updates
- Ensure version control for questionnaire changes
- Maintain audit trail of questionnaire versions

### Compliance Notes
- Unified approach simplifies regulatory compliance
- Consistent screening reduces compliance risk
