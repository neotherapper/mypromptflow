## Dual KYC Approach

### Comprehensive KYC Framework

### Corporate Customer KYC

- **Temporary Access**: Customers can access app with dummy data
- **App Trial**: Full app functionality with sample/dummy data
- **Upselling Process**: Convert trial users to full customers
- **Eventual Validation**: Admin validation required for full access

#### Option 2: Admin Approval Flow
