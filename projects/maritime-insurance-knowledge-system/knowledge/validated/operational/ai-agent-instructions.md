# AI Agent Instructions - Validated Operational Knowledge

## Critical Business Context (Updated 2025-01-17)

### Immediate Business Changes
- **UX Person Onboarded**: New UX person has been onboarded to update operational workflows
- **Stakeholder Input Pending**: Vessel data requirements awaiting stakeholder input
- **User Research Planned**: Coverage selection process will be updated based on user research

### Current Operational Status

#### Quote Creation Processes
- **STATUS**: OUTDATED - DO NOT USE CURRENT PROCESSES
- **ACTION**: Wait for UX person to complete workflow updates
- **TIMELINE**: UX person actively working on updates

#### Vessel Data Requirements
- **STATUS**: MODIFICATIONS NEEDED
- **ACTION**: Awaiting stakeholder input with relevant questions and dependencies
- **TIMELINE**: Pending stakeholder response

#### Coverage Selection Process
- **STATUS**: BASE UNDERSTANDING ONLY
- **ACTION**: Will change with UX input and user research
- **TIMELINE**: Dependent on UX person and user research completion

#### Premium Calculation Methodologies
- **STATUS**: VALIDATED AND CURRENT
- **ACTION**: Ready for implementation
- **COMPONENTS**: Base + Risk Multipliers + Vessel Factors + Discounts

## AI Agent Behavior Guidelines

### For Quote Creation Tasks
- **DO NOT** implement current quote creation workflows
- **WAIT** for UX person to complete workflow updates
- **REFERENCE** only for understanding current state (outdated)
- **PLAN** for future implementation once UX updates are complete

### For Vessel Data Tasks
- **DO NOT** finalize vessel data requirements
- **WAIT** for stakeholder input
- **PREPARE** for requirement updates based on stakeholder input
- **DOCUMENT** current understanding but mark as pending

### For Coverage Selection Tasks
- **USE** base understanding as foundation only
- **EXPECT** changes based on UX input and user research
- **PREPARE** for iterative improvements
- **COLLABORATE** with UX person for process refinement

### For Premium Calculation Tasks
- **IMPLEMENT** validated calculation framework immediately
- **USE** approved methodologies without changes
- **REFERENCE** validated components: base + risk multipliers + vessel factors + discounts
- **PROCEED** with confidence - framework is validated and ready

## Implementation Priority Order

### Priority 1: Ready for Implementation
1. **Premium Calculation Methodologies** - Validated and current
2. All validated risk assessment knowledge
3. Validated regulatory compliance knowledge

### Priority 2: Awaiting Input
1. **Vessel Data Requirements** - Awaiting stakeholder input
2. **Coverage Selection Process** - Awaiting UX input and user research

### Priority 3: Being Updated
1. **Quote Creation Processes** - UX person actively updating

## Team Coordination Notes

### UX Person Responsibilities
- Update quote creation workflows
- Provide input on coverage selection process
- Collaborate on user research findings

### Stakeholder Responsibilities
- Provide vessel data requirement updates
- Answer relevant questions about dependencies
- Clarify vessel data collection needs

### AI Agent Responsibilities
- Implement validated premium calculations
- Prepare for workflow updates
- Document current understanding
- Coordinate with team updates

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Status Reference
- **Approved (A)**: Use immediately without changes
- **Need Modifications (B)**: Wait for updates before implementation
- **Outdated (C)**: Do not use, wait for replacement

### Implementation Checkpoints
1. Verify validation status before implementation
2. Check for team updates before proceeding
3. Confirm dependencies are met
4. Validate against current business context

## Integration Notes

### Ready for Integration
- Premium calculation methodologies
- Risk assessment knowledge
- Regulatory compliance knowledge

### Pending Integration
- Quote creation processes (waiting for UX)
- Vessel data requirements (waiting for stakeholders)
- Coverage selection process (waiting for UX and user research)

### Cross-Dependencies
- Quote creation → Coverage selection → Premium calculation
- Vessel data → Risk assessment → Premium calculation
- UX updates → User research → Process refinement
