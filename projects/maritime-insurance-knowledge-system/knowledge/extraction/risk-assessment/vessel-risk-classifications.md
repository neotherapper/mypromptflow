## Extracted Knowledge (PENDING VALIDATION)

### Vessel Type Classifications
- **Status**: Pending validation (Question #004)
- **Confidence**: 85%
- **Knowledge**: Vessel type classifications are used to determine risk profiles, with different vessel types receiving different base rates and risk multipliers
- **Context**: Technical and Operational Risk Factors document shows different vessel types receiving different risk profiles. Premium examples demonstrate varied pricing for different vessel classifications

### Vessel Data Requirements
- **Status**: Pending validation (Question #006)
- **Confidence**: 80%
- **Knowledge**: Specific vessel data fields are required for risk modeling, including vessel characteristics, operational history, and technical specifications
- **Context**: Data_to_be_modeled.xlsx file contains vessel data requirements for modeling purposes. This data appears to be foundational for risk calculations

### Risk Profile Components
- **Vessel Type**: Primary classification factor
- **Technical Specifications**: Operational capabilities and limitations
- **Operational History**: Performance and incident records
- **Route Compatibility**: Vessel suitability for specific routes

### Premium Examples Analysis
- **CMA CGM - CHANCE - VP.xlsx**: Commercial vessel pricing model
- **HONG G - Quote.xlsx**: Asian route vessel example
- **Classification Variance**: Different vessel types show varied pricing structures

### Risk Assessment Framework
- **Base Classification**: Vessel type determines base risk category
- **Technical Factors**: Operational risk assessments
- **Historical Data**: Past performance impacts current risk ratings
- **Route Matching**: Vessel-route compatibility assessments

## Validation Requirements
1. Confirm current vessel type classification accuracy
2. Verify vessel data requirements completeness
3. Validate risk profile methodologies
4. Confirm technical risk factor relevance

## Implementation Considerations
- Vessel classification database needs regular updates
- Technical risk factors require industry expertise
- Operational history tracking systems needed
- Route compatibility algorithms required

## Data Fields for Risk Modeling
Based on Data_to_be_modeled.xlsx (pending validation):
- Vessel characteristics
- Operational history
- Technical specifications
- Performance metrics
- Safety records
- Route history

## Next Steps
- Await user validation responses
- Update knowledge base with approved facts
- Create vessel classification system design
- Implement risk profile calculation engines
