### 2. Customer Management Processes
- **B2C controlled registration** with document verification steps
- **Customer onboarding sequence** from registration to first quote generation
- **Account activation procedures** for individual vessel owners
- **Customer profile setup** and vessel information collection

### 3. Vessel Management Operations
- **Fleet management interfaces** for customers with multiple vessels
- **Vessel data collection requirements** for risk modeling and quote generation
- **Vessel details and values** capture through customer interfaces
- **Insurance history tracking** per vessel

### 4. Premium Calculation Methodologies
- **Structured calculation patterns**: base premium + risk multipliers + vessel factors + discounts
- **Discount structures**: volume discounts, loyalty discounts, negotiated rates
- **Risk multiplier applications**: port-specific, vessel-type, voyage-based adjustments
- **Multi-currency pricing considerations**

**Validation Required**: Confirm current vessel data requirements for B2C quote generation

### Premium Calculation Operations (Confidence: 92%)

**Extracted Knowledge**:
- Base premium + risk multipliers + vessel factors + applicable discounts
- Port-specific risk ratings and multipliers
- Vessel type classifications with different risk profiles
- Discount structures including volume and loyalty discounts

**Source Files**:
- Multiple premium examples with consistent calculation patterns
- OLYMPIC FIGHTER Quote showing 32.5% discount structure
- Various route and port-specific premium calculations

**Validation Required**: Confirm current premium calculation methodologies for B2C customers

## Critical Operational Findings Requiring Validation

### High Priority Validation Items

1. **Multi-step Quote Creation Process**: Are the customer view and PMSC view interfaces still current?
2. **Vessel Data Collection Requirements**: What specific vessel information is required from B2C customers?
3. **Coverage Selection Workflow**: How do B2C customers select coverage options during quote generation?
4. **Premium Calculation Accuracy**: Are the calculation methodologies shown still accurate for B2C customers?

### Medium Priority Validation Items

1. **Quote Review and Approval**: What approval workflows exist for B2C customer quotes?
2. **Customer Onboarding Currency**: Are the B2C registration processes still current?
3. **Fleet Management Applicability**: How do individual vessel owners manage multiple vessels?

## Potential Operational Conflicts Identified

1. **B2C vs B2B Features**: Some operational processes may be designed for B2B rather than B2C customers
2. **Quote Approval Complexity**: Internal approval processes may not be suitable for B2C self-service model
3. **Vessel Data Requirements**: Corporate vessel data requirements may be excessive for individual customers

## Operational Process Dependencies

### Risk Assessment Integration
- Quote generation depends on accurate risk assessment calculations
- Vessel data collection feeds into risk modeling systems
- Premium calculations require current risk factors and multipliers

### Regulatory Compliance Integration
- Customer onboarding must include sanctions screening and KYC verification
- Quote generation must comply with maritime insurance regulations
- Vessel registration must meet regulatory requirements

### Business Intelligence Integration
- Operational processes must support competitive pricing strategies
- Customer data collection must enable business intelligence analysis
- Quote generation must support market positioning objectives

## Next Steps for Operational Knowledge Validation

1. **Generate Specific Validation Questions**: Create detailed questions for each operational process area
2. **User Validation Sessions**: Present operational knowledge to users for approval/modification
3. **Process Documentation Updates**: Update operational documentation based on validation results
4. **Integration Planning**: Plan integration of validated operational knowledge into knowledge base

## Files Requiring Additional Operational Analysis

1. **Binary Files**: Customer view screenshots, PMSC view screenshots need detailed UI/UX analysis
2. **Excel Files**: Premium calculation examples need formula extraction and validation
3. **PDF Files**: B2C registration documentation needs comprehensive content review
4. **Process Flow Documentation**: Multi-step workflows need detailed sequence mapping
