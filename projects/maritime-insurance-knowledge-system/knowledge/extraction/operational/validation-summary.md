**Extracted Knowledge**:
B2C customer onboarding includes controlled registration with document verification, account activation, customer profile setup, and vessel information collection before customers can access quote generation capabilities.

## Medium Priority Validation Items

### 6. Quote Review and Approval Workflows

**Question ID**: question_019  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Confidence Score**: 80%  
**Source**: PMSC view screenshots, Quote management interfaces  

**Validation Required**:
- What are the current quote review and approval workflows for B2C customers, and do internal agents still use PMSC interfaces for quote management?

**Context**:
PMSC view screenshots suggest internal quote management dashboards and approval workflows. Understanding review and approval processes for B2C operations is important for workflow accuracy.

**Extracted Knowledge**:
Quote review and approval involves internal PMSC (Project Management and Support Center) interfaces where agents can review, modify, and approve quotes generated by B2C customers, suggesting a hybrid self-service and agent-assisted model.

### 7. Fleet Management for Individual Customers

**Question ID**: question_021  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Confidence Score**: 75%  
**Source**: Fleet management interfaces, Vessel management screenshots  

**Validation Required**:
