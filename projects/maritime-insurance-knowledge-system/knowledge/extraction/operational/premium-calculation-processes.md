## Executive Summary

This document details the premium calculation processes extracted from maritime insurance knowledge system analysis. The processes include structured calculation methodologies, risk multiplier applications, discount structures, and B2C-specific pricing considerations based on multiple premium examples and calculation models.

## Premium Calculation Structure

### Core Calculation Formula

**Base Formula**:
```
Total Premium = Base Premium + Risk Multipliers + Vessel Factors + Adjustments - Discounts
```

**Component Breakdown**:
1. **Base Premium**: Standard rate for vessel type and coverage
2. **Risk Multipliers**: Port-specific, route-based, and temporal risk factors
3. **Vessel Factors**: Tonnage, age, classification, and operational history
4. **Adjustments**: Seasonal, currency, and market condition adjustments
5. **Discounts**: Volume, loyalty, and negotiated rate reductions

### Calculation Methodology Analysis

**Consistent Patterns Identified** (from premium examples):
- All premium examples follow the same basic calculation structure
- Risk multipliers are applied consistently across different vessel types
- Discount structures show systematic application rules
- Currency considerations are integrated into calculation process
