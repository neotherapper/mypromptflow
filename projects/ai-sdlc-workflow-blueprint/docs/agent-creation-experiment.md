6. **Professional Architecture**: Registry system, cross-stage integration, shared resources

**ðŸ“Š Current Portfolio Inventory:**

**Core SDLC Agents (7):**
- `requirements-analyst` (Stage 1) - Business requirements with JIRA automation
- `ui-ux-specialist` (Stage 2) - Figma integration, design systems, accessibility
- `system-architect` (Stage 2) - AWS infrastructure, React/FastAPI/PostgreSQL stack
- `capacity-planner` (Stage 3) - AI-enhanced capacity planning, skill-based assignment
- `implementation-lead` (Stage 4) - Development coordination, code quality enforcement
- `qa-specialist` (Stage 5) - Comprehensive testing, performance validation
- `deployment-coordinator` (Stage 6) - Production deployments, monitoring setup

**Supporting Framework Agents (18+):**
- `research-specialist` - Multi-agent research coordination
- `information-access-specialist` - Unified source discovery framework
- `mcp-troubleshooting-expert` - Infrastructure support and error handling
- Various validators, coordinators, and quality assurance agents

### Strategic Gap Analysis

**ðŸŽ¯ Enhancement Opportunities Identified:**

1. **Security Specialization Gap**: No dedicated security-focused code review specialist
2. **Performance Optimization Gap**: Performance handled generically across agents
3. **API/Integration Specialist Gap**: WorkOS/JIRA integrations embedded in other agents
4. **Database Specialist Gap**: PostgreSQL expertise distributed across system-architect
5. **Frontend Technology Gap**: React/TypeScript could benefit from dedicated specialist

## Phase 2: /Agent Generation Strategy

### AI-Generated Agent Creation

Based on research findings, created 5 strategic /agent specialists to address identified gaps:

#### 1. Security Code Reviewer Specialist

**Generated Command:**
```bash
/agent Create a security code review specialist expert in OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and maritime insurance compliance requirements. 

Focus on:
- Vulnerability assessment for React/TypeScript frontend and FastAPI/Python backend
- WorkOS authentication security validation and session management
- Maritime insurance regulatory compliance (GDPR, financial data protection)
- Database security for PostgreSQL with sensitive maritime data
- API security patterns and rate limiting implementation
- Security testing integration with existing qa-specialist workflows

Provide actionable security recommendations with implementation guidance and integration patterns for JIRA issue creation. Maintain context isolation and support parallel operation with existing SDLC agents.
```

**Strategic Purpose**: Address security specialization gap with dedicated OWASP expertise and maritime compliance focus.

#### 2. Performance Optimization Specialist

**Generated Command:**
```bash
/agent Create a full-stack performance optimization specialist for React/FastAPI/PostgreSQL maritime insurance applications.

Expertise areas:
- React performance optimization (memo, useMemo, useCallback, code splitting)
- FastAPI backend performance tuning (async patterns, database optimization)
- PostgreSQL query optimization and indexing strategies
- AWS infrastructure scaling (CloudFront, ECS, RDS optimization)
- Performance monitoring integration with Sentry
- Maritime insurance specific performance patterns (large data sets, complex calculations)

Provide measurable performance improvements with specific metrics and coordinate with system-architect for infrastructure changes. Support integration with existing SDLC workflow and maintain quality standards alignment.
```

**Strategic Purpose**: Dedicated performance expertise across full stack with maritime-specific optimization patterns.

#### 3. API Integration Specialist

**Generated Command:**
```bash
/agent Create an API integration specialist focused on maritime insurance platform external service coordination.

Specializations:
- WorkOS authentication integration patterns and troubleshooting
- JIRA API automation for maritime insurance workflows  
- Sentry integration for error tracking and performance monitoring
- PostgreSQL database integration patterns and migration strategies
- RESTful API design following OpenAPI standards
- Rate limiting, retry logic, and circuit breaker patterns

Coordinate with implementation-lead for development integration and system-architect for infrastructure requirements. Provide comprehensive integration documentation and troubleshooting guides with SDLC workflow alignment.
```

**Strategic Purpose**: Centralize external service integration expertise with focus on WorkOS, JIRA, and Sentry patterns.

#### 4. Database Architecture Specialist

**Generated Command:**
```bash
/agent Create a PostgreSQL database architecture specialist for maritime insurance data management.

Core expertise:
- Maritime insurance database schema design (policies, claims, vessels, underwriting)
- PostgreSQL performance optimization and query tuning
- Database migration strategies with zero-downtime requirements
- Data modeling for complex maritime insurance relationships
- Compliance and audit logging for regulatory requirements
- Integration with FastAPI ORM patterns and optimization

Work closely with system-architect for infrastructure decisions and implementation-lead for development coordination. Ensure data security and regulatory compliance while maintaining performance standards for maritime insurance operations.
```

**Strategic Purpose**: Dedicated database expertise with maritime insurance domain modeling and compliance focus.

#### 5. React/TypeScript Frontend Specialist

**Generated Command:**
```bash
/agent Create a React/TypeScript frontend specialist for maritime insurance user interfaces.

Specialized knowledge:
- Modern React patterns (hooks, context, state management with Zustand)
- TypeScript strict mode implementation and type system design
- Maritime insurance UI/UX patterns and component libraries
- Integration with Figma design systems and ui-ux-specialist coordination
- Performance optimization for complex maritime data visualization
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA) for insurance professionals

Coordinate with ui-ux-specialist for design implementation and system-architect for API integration. Maintain component library standards and support comprehensive testing integration with qa-specialist workflows.
```

**Strategic Purpose**: Advanced React/TypeScript expertise with maritime UI patterns and coordination with existing design workflows.
