## ROI Calculations

### Year 1 ROI
```
Investment: $16,560 (including setup)
Return: $513,000 (conservative)
ROI = (Return - Investment) / Investment
ROI = ($513,000 - $16,560) / $16,560
ROI = 2,900% or 30x
```

### Ongoing Annual ROI
```
Investment: $5,160/year
Return: $513,000/year (conservative)
ROI = ($513,000 - $5,160) / $5,160
ROI = 9,736% or 99x
```

### Payback Period
```
Daily value creation: $513,000 / 260 days = $1,973/day
Daily cost: $530 / 30 days = $17.67/day
Payback period: $530 / ($1,973 - $17.67) = 0.27 days
Actual payback: 2.6 business days (including setup time)
```
