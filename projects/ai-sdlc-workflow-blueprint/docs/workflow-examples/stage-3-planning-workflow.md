Prompt: "Analyze the Fleet Risk Assessment Dashboard development plan and identify 
potential risks, bottlenecks, and mitigation strategies."

Claude Response:
## Risk Analysis & Mitigation Plan

### High Priority Risks

1. **Real-time Data Processing Bottleneck**
   - Risk: System cannot process 500+ vessels in 5-minute window
   - Probability: Medium (40%)
   - Impact: High - Core feature failure
   - Mitigation:
     * Implement streaming architecture early
     * Use Apache Kafka for event processing
     * Design for horizontal scaling
     * Create performance benchmarks in Sprint 1

2. **Third-party API Dependencies**
   - Risk: AIS/Weather API downtime or rate limiting
   - Probability: High (60%)
   - Impact: Medium - Degraded functionality
   - Mitigation:
     * Implement robust caching layer
     * Create fallback data sources
     * Design circuit breakers
     * Negotiate SLAs with providers

3. **Frontend Performance with Large Datasets**
   - Risk: Dashboard becomes unresponsive with 500+ vessels
   - Probability: Medium (35%)
   - Impact: Medium - Poor user experience
   - Mitigation:
     * Implement virtualization from day 1
     * Use Web Workers for calculations
     * Progressive data loading
     * Client-side data aggregation

### Technical Debt Prevention

1. **Code Quality Gates**
   - Automated linting (ESLint, Pylint)
   - Mandatory code reviews
   - Test coverage minimum 80%
   - Performance benchmarks in CI/CD

2. **Architecture Decision Records**
   - Document all major decisions
   - Review in sprint retrospectives
   - Update as understanding evolves

### Recommended Sprint 1 Adjustments

1. Add spike tasks:
   - RISK-015: Performance testing harness (3 pts)
   - RISK-016: API fallback mechanism POC (2 pts)

2. Adjust priorities:
   - Move monitoring setup earlier
   - Parallel work on caching layer
```

### Day 2 Afternoon: Resource Optimization

#### 2:00 PM - Cross-team Dependencies and Planning

**Project Manager creates dependency matrix in Notion:**

```markdown
## Dependency Matrix

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Ingestion] --> B[Validation Layer]
    B --> C[Risk Calculator]
    C --> D[Cache Layer]
    D --> E[API Response]
    
    F[Weather API] --> B

   - Retrieve vessel specifications
   - Load historical incident data

2. **Risk Scoring** (Parallel)
   ```python
   risk_factors = {
       'location_risk': calculate_location_risk(position, zones),
       'weather_risk': calculate_weather_risk(weather_data),
       'vessel_risk': calculate_vessel_risk(vessel_specs),
       'route_risk': calculate_route_risk(route_history),
       'cargo_risk': calculate_cargo_risk(cargo_type)
   }
   
   total_risk = sum(
       factor * RISK_WEIGHTS[name] 
       for name, factor in risk_factors.items()
   )
   ```

3. **Alert Generation**
   - Compare against thresholds
   - Check alert suppression rules
   - Generate notifications

### Performance Targets
- Single vessel calculation: <50ms
- Batch processing (100 vessels): <2s
- Full fleet (500 vessels): <15s
