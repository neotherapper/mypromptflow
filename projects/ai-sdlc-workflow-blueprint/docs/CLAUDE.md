# Deliverable Creation Protocol

## Purpose of This Folder

The `/docs/` folder contains final blueprint deliverables built from user-agreed decisions and consolidated knowledge. These are the actionable materials that enable AI-SDLC implementation.

## Creation Dependencies

### ❌ Currently Blocked - Awaiting Decisions
**Cannot proceed** until `/decisions/` folder contains:
- **Team Structure**: Required for training materials and role assignments
- **Tool Selection**: Required for implementation guides and setup procedures
- **Workflow Stages**: Required for visual diagrams and process documentation

### ✅ Ready When Decisions Complete
All deliverable creation can proceed once decisions are finalized.

## Deliverable Creation Standards

### Quality Requirements
- **Built from Decisions**: Use only user-agreed choices, no assumptions
- **Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate research findings accurately
- **Implementation Ready**: Immediately actionable without additional planning
- **Complete Coverage**: Address all aspects of AI-SDLC implementation
- **Source Traceability**: Clear links to decisions and knowledge sources

### Content Standards
- **Specific Guidance**: "Do X with tool Y to achieve outcome Z"
- **Clear Ownership**: "Role A does task B using process C"
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Define success criteria and validation methods
- **Risk Awareness**: Address potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Future Adaptability**: Design for evolution and improvement

## Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Dependencies
- **Check Decisions**: Ensure all required decisions are finalized
- **Validate Knowledge**: Confirm knowledge base is complete
- **Review Requirements**: Align with project purpose and success criteria

### Step 2: Design Deliverable
- **Structure Planning**: Organize content for maximum usability
- **Template Selection**: Use appropriate format for deliverable type
- **Quality Framework**: Define validation criteria for completeness

### Step 3: Create Content
- **Decision Integration**: Incorporate all relevant user choices
- **Knowledge Application**: Use research findings appropriately
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure content meets standards

### Step 4: Validate Deliverable
- **Completeness Check**: All requirements addressed
- **Accuracy Verification**: Information validated against sources
- **Usability Testing**: Content is actionable and clear
- **Consistency Review**: Aligns with other deliverables

## Current Status

### Blocked Work
**All deliverable creation** awaits completion of user decisions in `/decisions/` folder.

### Ready to Execute
Once decisions are complete, all deliverables can be created simultaneously as they build from the same decision foundation.

### Quality Assurance
**Pre-flight checks**: Validate decisions exist and knowledge base is complete
**Creation validation**: Ensure deliverables meet quality standards
**User validation**: Confirm deliverables meet original requirements

Remember: Deliverables represent the final blueprint value - they must be immediately actionable and built from validated decisions and knowledge.
