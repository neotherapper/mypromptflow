## üöÄ Quick Start Implementation

### Phase 1: Account Setup (Week 1)
1. Follow `workos-setup-training.md` for account creation
2. Configure staging and production environments
3. Set up webhook endpoints and API keys

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Week 2)
1. Use `workos-implementation-guide.md` sections 3-4
2. Implement React AuthKit provider and protected routes
3. Follow `workos-jwt-authentication-flow.md` for token handling

### Phase 3: Backend Integration (Week 3)
1. Implement FastAPI authentication middleware
2. Use `workos-rbac-implementation-guide.md` for permission system
3. Set up maritime audit logging per compliance requirements

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (Week 4)
1. Follow production deployment section in implementation guide
2. Configure monitoring and alerting
3. Complete team training and go-live validation

## üéØ Key Implementation Decisions

### Authentication Architecture
- **Frontend**: React AuthKit SDK handles complete OAuth flow and session management
- **Backend**: Python SDK verifies JWT tokens and extracts user context
- **Storage**: Hybrid RBAC with basic roles in JWT, detailed permissions in database

### Maritime Compliance
- **7-year audit retention** with automated archival
- **Multi-tenant isolation** for ship owners, cargo owners, brokers, charterers
- **Geographic restrictions** for territorial waters and international shipping
- **Real-time monitoring** with compliance alerting

### Security Features
- **Enterprise-grade authentication** with SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA compliance
- **JWT token verification** with automatic refresh and secure storage
- **Permission caching** with multi-level cache (memory + Redis) for performance
- **Complete audit trail** for all authentication and authorization events

## üí° Architecture Highlights

### What WorkOS Handles Automatically
‚úÖ OAuth 2.0 + PKCE flow implementation  
‚úÖ JWT token generation, signing, and validation

‚úÖ Enterprise security features (CSRF, XSS protection)  
‚úÖ Multi-tenant organization management  

### What You Implement  
üîß Maritime-specific business logic and UI components  
üîß Vessel permissions and tenant-specific access control  
üîß 7-year audit logging for maritime compliance  
üîß Geographic restrictions and time-based permissions  
üîß Integration with existing FastAPI backend and React frontend
