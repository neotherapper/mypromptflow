   - **Phase 2**: Ephemeral PR environments with auto-cleanup and isolation
   - **Phase 3**: Blue-green deployment and advanced cost optimization
   - Tool selection decisions matrix with adoption recommendations
   - Updated technology stack combining VanguardAI innovations with existing decisions
   - Created in: `docs/implementation-guide/aws-strategic-recommendations.md`

#### Key VanguardAI Innovations Analyzed
**Serverless-First Architecture**:
- **App Runner**: Scale-to-zero capability, 70% cost reduction vs ECS alternatives
- **Aurora Serverless v2**: Auto-pause feature saves 80% on development environments  
- **Ephemeral Environments**: $12/month per PR vs $100+/month traditional approaches
- **Advanced Cost Optimization**: Reserved capacity, spot instances, aggressive caching

**CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements**:
- **Preview Environments**: Automatic per-PR infrastructure with unique subdomains
- **Comprehensive Testing**: E2E testing on isolated environments before merge
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Resource destruction on PR close with 24-hour timeout
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Production deployment safety with automated rollback

**Environment Management**:
- **Secrets Manager + Parameter Store**: Hybrid approach for credentials and configuration
- **OIDC Authentication**: GitHub Actions with IAM roles (no long-lived credentials)
- **Multi-Environment Strategy**: Preview (auto-pause), UAT (production-like), Production (full-scale)
