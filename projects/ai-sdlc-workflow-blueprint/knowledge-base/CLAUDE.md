## Knowledge Consolidation Standards

### Quality Criteria
- **Source Attribution**: All insights linked to research sources
- **Accuracy Validation**: Cross-reference conflicting information
- **Completeness Check**: Ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Decision Readiness**: Organize for user choice presentation

### Organization Principles
- **Topic Clustering**: Group related insights together
- **Priority Ordering**: Most important insights first
- **Comparison Framework**: Enable option evaluation
- **Implementation Focus**: Emphasize actionable guidance

## Gap Identification Methodology

### Gap Categories
1. **Tool Gaps**: Missing tool analysis or comparison data
2. **Process Gaps**: Incomplete workflow or procedure definition
3. **Team Gaps**: Unclear role definitions or collaboration patterns
4. **Implementation Gaps**: Missing setup or configuration guidance
5. **Validation Gaps**: Insufficient quality or success criteria

### Gap Assessment Criteria
- **Decision Impact**: Does gap block important user decisions?
- **Implementation Risk**: Does gap create implementation uncertainty?
- **Quality Impact**: Does gap reduce blueprint effectiveness?
- **Research Feasibility**: Can gap be filled with available resources?
