- Defect Rate: 45% reduction
- Overall Productivity: 65-80% improvement
- Time to Market: 50% faster

**Quality Improvements**:
- First-pass code quality increase
- Reduced technical debt accumulation
- Better requirement clarity
- Improved documentation coverage

### Implementation Approach

**Month 1: Foundation**
- Week 1-2: Document detailed workflows for each stage
- Week 3: Create templates and checklists
- Week 4: Run pilot feature through all stages

**Month 2: Full Adoption**
- Week 1-2: Implement across all active features
- Week 3: Gather team feedback and refine
- Week 4: Measure and report on metrics

### Key Integration Points

1. **JIRA Integration**:
   - Stages 1, 3, 4: Automated ticket management
   - All stages: Progress tracking and reporting

2. **Figma Integration**:
   - Stage 2: Design creation and review
   - Stage 4: Design-to-code reference

3. **Git/GitHub Integration**:
   - Stages 4, 5, 6: Version control and CI/CD

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All team members trained on new workflow
- [ ] Templates created for each stage
- [ ] Metrics baseline established
- [ ] First feature successfully delivered
- [ ] ROI measurements in place

### Adjustments from Standard Option 1
