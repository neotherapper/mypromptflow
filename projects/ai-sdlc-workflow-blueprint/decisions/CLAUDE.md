# Decision Management Guide

## Purpose of This Folder

The `/decisions/` folder contains **only user-agreed choices** with complete reasoning and alternatives considered. This is the authoritative source for what has been decided vs what still needs agreement.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Folder Structure

- **`/decisions/`** - ONLY finalized decisions with user agreement
- **`/options/`** - Decision option analyses and research-based recommendations

**Rule**: Move files from `/options/` to `/decisions/` only after user confirmation.

## Decision Status Dashboard

### ❌ Pending User Decisions
- **Team Structure**: 4-person setup + stakeholder roles and responsibilities
- **Tool Selection**: Specific AI tools with cost-benefit justification
- **SDLC Stages**: Workflow stages (dev/uat/production) and processes
- **Quality Procedures**: Testing, validation, and quality assurance approaches

### ✅ Confirmed Decisions
*None yet - awaiting user input*

## Decision Documentation Standards

### Required Format for All Decision Files

```markdown
# [Decision Topic]

## Decision Made
**Selected Option**: [Specific choice]
**Date Decided**: [Date]
**Decision Authority**: [User confirmation method]

## Reasoning
**Why This Choice**: [Primary justification]
**Key Benefits**: [Specific advantages]
**Trade-offs Accepted**: [Known limitations]

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Option A**: [Description + pros/cons]
2. **Option B**: [Description + pros/cons]
3. **Option C**: [Description + pros/cons]

## Implementation Requirements
**Dependencies**: [What this decision enables/requires]
**Next Steps**: [What can now be done]
**Validation Criteria**: [How to measure success]

## Change Management
**Locked Until**: [When this can be revisited]
**Change Process**: [How to modify if needed]
```

### Quality Gates for Decision Documentation

- ✅ **User Confirmation**: Clear evidence of user agreement
- ✅ **Complete Reasoning**: Why this choice over alternatives
- ✅ **Implementation Path**: What this enables and requires
- ✅ **Change Control**: When and how decisions can be modified

## Decision Process Protocols

### 1. Prepare Decision Materials
**From Knowledge Base**: Use research findings to create option analysis
**Present Clearly**: Show pros/cons, costs, implementation requirements
**Include Recommendations**: Provide AI analysis of best options
**Show Dependencies**: Explain what this decision enables/blocks

### 2. Get User Agreement
**Present Options**: Clear format with reasoning for each
**Ask Explicitly**: "Which option do you choose and why?"
**Confirm Understanding**: Ensure user sees implications
**Document Choice**: Record exact user response

### 3. Lock Decision
**Create Decision File**: Use standard format in this folder
**Update Dependencies**: Enable blocked work to proceed
**Notify System**: Update main CLAUDE.md with decision status
**Track History**: Add to agreements-log.md

### 4. Enable Next Work
**Update Project Status**: What can now be done
**Unblock Tasks**: Start decision-dependent work
**Validate Usage**: Ensure decisions are used correctly in deliverables

## Decision Categories and Dependencies

### Primary Decisions (Block Major Work)
1. **Team Structure** → Enables training materials, role assignments
2. **Tool Selection** → Enables implementation guides, cost analysis
3. **SDLC Stages** → Enables workflow diagrams, process documentation

### Secondary Decisions (Refinement)
1. **Quality Procedures** → Enhances testing and validation guidance
2. **Training Approach** → Optimizes onboarding and skill development
3. **Metrics Framework** → Improves success measurement

## Decision Validation Rules

### Before Creating Decision Files
- ❌ **No Assumptions**: Never assume user preferences
- ❌ **No Defaults**: Always present options for user choice
- ❌ **No Inferring**: Explicit agreement required

### When Using Decisions
- ✅ **Follow Exactly**: Use decisions as documented
- ✅ **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required decisions exist
- ✅ **Validate Consistency**: Ensure decisions work together

### Decision Modification
- **User Request Required**: Only user can change decisions
- **Impact Analysis**: Show what changes if decision modified
- **Re-validation**: Check all dependent work still valid

## Current Priority Actions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Knowledge Base**: Finish research consolidation
2. **Prepare Decision Materials**: Create user-ready option analysis
3. **Schedule Decision Sessions**: Present options for user choice

### Waiting For
- **User Availability**: Need user input for major decisions
- **Complete Research**: Some gaps still being filled
- **Option Analysis**: Final preparation of decision materials

## File Naming Conventions

- `team-structure.md` - Team roles and responsibilities
- `tools-selected.md` - AI tool choices with reasoning  
- `workflow-stages.md` - SDLC stages and processes
- `processes-defined.md` - Quality and procedure definitions
- `agreements-log.md` - Complete decision history

## Quality Assurance

### Decision File Checklist
- [ ] User agreement clearly documented
- [ ] All alternatives considered and documented  
- [ ] Implementation requirements specified
- [ ] Dependencies and enablements identified
- [ ] Change management process defined

### Usage Validation
- [ ] Decisions used correctly in deliverables
- [ ] No work proceeds without required decisions
- [ ] Dependencies properly tracked and respected
- [ ] Quality maintained throughout implementation

Remember: This folder represents **committed choices** that enable confident implementation. No guessing, no assumptions - only documented user agreements.
