#### Setup Example
```javascript
// ProductCard.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ProductCard } from './ProductCard';

test('adds product to cart when button clicked', async () => {
  const mockAddToCart = jest.fn();
  render(<ProductCard product={mockProduct} onAddToCart={mockAddToCart} />);
  
  const addButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /add to cart/i });
  fireEvent.click(addButton);
  
  expect(mockAddToCart).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockProduct);
});
```
