## Dependency Chain Visualization

```
Phase 1 Foundation → Phase 2 Knowledge → Phase 3 Decisions → Phase 4 Creation → Phase 5 Validation
     ↓                     ↓                  ↓                    ↓                   ↓
Research Extract    →  Gap Analysis   →  User Choices   →   Deliverables    →   Final Blueprint
Knowledge Org       →  Preparation    →  Documentation  →   Implementation   →   Enhancement Plan
Task Planning       →  Decision Ready →  Agreements     →   Validation      →   Project Complete
```

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Immediate Blockers
1. **Knowledge extraction must complete** before gap analysis
2. **Gap analysis must complete** before decision preparation  
3. **All decisions must be made** before any deliverable creation
4. **Tool + team decisions required** for most deliverables

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- **Research extraction** can happen in parallel across different sources
- **Decision preparation** can proceed for different decision types simultaneously
- **Deliverable creation** can happen in parallel once decisions are complete

## Next Actions Priority

### High Priority (Do First)
1. Extract AI-SDLC workflow research
2. Extract AI frontend development research  
3. Complete task list creation (this file)

### Medium Priority (Do Next)
1. Consolidate supporting research
2. Create source mapping
3. Identify knowledge gaps

### Low Priority (Do Later)
1. Supporting documentation (README, personas)
2. Progress tracking updates
3. Project completion summary
