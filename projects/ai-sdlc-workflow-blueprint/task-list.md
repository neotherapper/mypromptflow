## Critical Path Dependencies

### Immediate Blockers
1. **Knowledge extraction must complete** before gap analysis
2. **Gap analysis must complete** before decision preparation  
3. **All decisions must be made** before any deliverable creation
4. **Tool + team decisions required** for most deliverables

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- **Research extraction** can happen in parallel across different sources
- **Decision preparation** can proceed for different decision types simultaneously
- **Deliverable creation** can happen in parallel once decisions are complete

## Next Actions Priority

### High Priority (Do First)
1. Extract AI-SDLC workflow research
2. Extract AI frontend development research  
3. Complete task list creation (this file)

### Medium Priority (Do Next)
1. Consolidate supporting research
2. Create source mapping
3. Identify knowledge gaps

### Low Priority (Do Later)
1. Supporting documentation (README, personas)
2. Progress tracking updates
3. Project completion summary
