# Project: AI-SDLC Workflow Blueprint

## Project Context

**Project Type**: Implementation Blueprint
**Status**: Phase 2.2 - Knowledge Base Consolidation (Phase 2.1 Complete)
**Priority**: High

## Project Summary

Create a comprehensive, practical blueprint for implementing AI-assisted SDLC workflows that serves as the definitive guide for engineering teams to adopt AI in their development processes.

**Goals**: Provide Head of Engineering with complete implementation guidance including tool selection, team assignments, stage-by-stage procedures, and cost justification.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Visual workflow from business ideation to production
- Tool selection with reasoning and costs
- Stage-by-stage implementation guide with clear outcomes
- Setup procedures enabling complete AI workflow implementation

**Approach**: Systematic knowledge consolidation ‚Üí user-agreed decisions ‚Üí actionable deliverables

**Constraints**: All major decisions require explicit user agreement; no assumptions about preferences

## Current Status

**Progress**: All critical knowledge gaps filled through comprehensive research

**Active Tasks**: Phase 2.2 - Finalizing knowledge base consolidation

**Blockers**: None currently (ready for user decisions once Phase 2.2 complete)

## Project Navigation System

### üéØ Current Phase: Phase 2.2 - Knowledge Base Consolidation
**What you can do now**: Final knowledge base consolidation and decision preparation
**What's blocked**: Decision-dependent work (tools, processes, diagrams)
**Next user decision needed**: Team structure, tool selection, SDLC stages

### üìÅ Folder Navigation Guide

#### `/decisions/` - Decision Management
- **Purpose**: Store all user-agreed choices and reasoning
- **Status**: Empty (no decisions made yet)
- **Next**: Need user decisions on team, tools, processes
- **Guide**: Read `/decisions/CLAUDE.md` for decision protocols

#### `/knowledge-base/` - Research Intelligence
- **Purpose**: Organized research findings ready for decision-making
- **Status**: Near completion (all critical gaps filled)
- **Current Work**: Final consolidation and decision preparation
- **Guide**: Read `/knowledge-base/CLAUDE.md` for research protocols

#### `/docs/` - Final Deliverables
- **Purpose**: Blueprint materials built from decisions + knowledge
- **Status**: Blocked until decisions are made
- **Dependencies**: Requires completed `/decisions/` folder
- **Guide**: Read `/docs/CLAUDE.md` for deliverable protocols

## AI Agent Instructions

### Phase-Based Working Pattern

**Phase 1 (COMPLETED)**: Foundation & Knowledge Work ‚úÖ
1. **Extract research knowledge** ‚Üí work in `/knowledge-base/` ‚úÖ
2. **Identify gaps** ‚Üí update gap analysis ‚úÖ
3. **Organize for decisions** ‚Üí prepare decision-ready materials ‚úÖ
4. **No user input required** ‚Üí work autonomously ‚úÖ

**Phase 2.1 (COMPLETED)**: Critical Gap Research ‚úÖ
1. **Fill critical gaps** ‚Üí conduct additional research if needed ‚úÖ
2. **Security & compliance framework** ‚Üí comprehensive research completed ‚úÖ
3. **Change management strategy** ‚Üí full methodology developed ‚úÖ
4. **Integration requirements** ‚Üí infrastructure analysis completed ‚úÖ
5. **Performance measurement** ‚Üí KPI framework established ‚úÖ

**Phase 2.2 (CURRENT)**: Knowledge Base Consolidation
1. **Complete knowledge base** ‚Üí finalize all analysis
2. **Prepare decision materials** ‚Üí ready for user review

**Phase 3**: Decision Making (User Required)
1. **Present options** ‚Üí use decision protocols
2. **Get explicit agreement** ‚Üí document in `/decisions/`
3. **Track decision history** ‚Üí maintain audit trail
4. **Wait for all decisions** before proceeding

**Phase 4**: Blueprint Creation
1. **Build from decisions** ‚Üí use agreed choices only
2. **Create deliverables** ‚Üí follow quality standards
3. **Validate completeness** ‚Üí ensure user requirements met

### Quality Standards

**Decision Documentation**: Include reasoning, alternatives, and user confirmation
**Knowledge Organization**: Source citations, gap identification, decision-ready format
**Deliverable Creation**: Built from decisions + knowledge, validated for completeness

### Dependency Rules

- ‚ùå No tool guidance without tool selection decisions
- ‚ùå No workflow diagrams without process decisions  
- ‚ùå No training materials without team structure decisions
- ‚úÖ Knowledge work can proceed independently
- ‚úÖ Gap analysis helps inform better decisions

## Next Steps for AI Agents

**Immediate (Phase 2.2)**:
1. Complete final knowledge base consolidation
2. Prepare decision-ready materials for user review
3. Organize comprehensive option presentations

**Upcoming (Phase 3)**:
1. Present decision options to user
2. Get explicit agreement on all choices
3. Document decisions and reasoning

**Future (Phase 4+)**:
1. Create blueprint deliverables from decisions
2. Validate and enhance final outputs
3. Complete comprehensive implementation guide
