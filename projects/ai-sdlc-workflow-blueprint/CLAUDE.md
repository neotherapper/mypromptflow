# Project: AI-SDLC Workflow Blueprint

## Project Context

**Project Type**: Implementation Blueprint
**Status**: Phase 1 - Foundation 
**Priority**: High

## Project Summary

Create a comprehensive, practical blueprint for implementing AI-assisted SDLC workflows that serves as the definitive guide for engineering teams to adopt AI in their development processes.

**Goals**: Provide Head of Engineering with complete implementation guidance including tool selection, team assignments, stage-by-stage procedures, and cost justification.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Visual workflow from business ideation to production
- Tool selection with reasoning and costs
- Stage-by-stage implementation guide with clear outcomes
- Setup procedures enabling complete AI workflow implementation

**Approach**: Systematic knowledge consolidation ‚Üí user-agreed decisions ‚Üí actionable deliverables

**Constraints**: All major decisions require explicit user agreement; no assumptions about preferences

## Current Status

**Progress**: Creating project structure and navigation system

**Active Tasks**: Phase 1.1 - Project structure and CLAUDE.md files

**Blockers**: None currently

## Project Navigation System

### üéØ Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation
**What you can do now**: Knowledge consolidation and organization work
**What's blocked**: Decision-dependent work (tools, processes, diagrams)
**Next user decision needed**: Team structure, tool selection, SDLC stages

### üìÅ Folder Navigation Guide

#### `/decisions/` - Decision Management
- **Purpose**: Store all user-agreed choices and reasoning
- **Status**: Empty (no decisions made yet)
- **Next**: Need user decisions on team, tools, processes
- **Guide**: Read `/decisions/CLAUDE.md` for decision protocols

#### `/knowledge-base/` - Research Intelligence
- **Purpose**: Organized research findings ready for decision-making
- **Status**: Work in progress (extracting from research)
- **Current Work**: Consolidating AI-SDLC and frontend research
- **Guide**: Read `/knowledge-base/CLAUDE.md` for research protocols

#### `/docs/` - Final Deliverables
- **Purpose**: Blueprint materials built from decisions + knowledge
- **Status**: Blocked until decisions are made
- **Dependencies**: Requires completed `/decisions/` folder
- **Guide**: Read `/docs/CLAUDE.md` for deliverable protocols

## AI Agent Instructions

### Phase-Based Working Pattern

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Foundation & Knowledge Work
1. **Extract research knowledge** ‚Üí work in `/knowledge-base/`
2. **Identify gaps** ‚Üí update gap analysis
3. **Organize for decisions** ‚Üí prepare decision-ready materials
4. **No user input required** ‚Üí work autonomously

**Phase 2**: Knowledge Completion
1. **Fill critical gaps** ‚Üí conduct additional research if needed
2. **Complete knowledge base** ‚Üí finalize all analysis
3. **Prepare decision materials** ‚Üí ready for user review

**Phase 3**: Decision Making (User Required)
1. **Present options** ‚Üí use decision protocols
2. **Get explicit agreement** ‚Üí document in `/decisions/`
3. **Track decision history** ‚Üí maintain audit trail
4. **Wait for all decisions** before proceeding

**Phase 4**: Blueprint Creation
1. **Build from decisions** ‚Üí use agreed choices only
2. **Create deliverables** ‚Üí follow quality standards
3. **Validate completeness** ‚Üí ensure user requirements met

### Quality Standards

**Decision Documentation**: Include reasoning, alternatives, and user confirmation
**Knowledge Organization**: Source citations, gap identification, decision-ready format
**Deliverable Creation**: Built from decisions + knowledge, validated for completeness

### Dependency Rules

- ‚ùå No tool guidance without tool selection decisions
- ‚ùå No workflow diagrams without process decisions  
- ‚ùå No training materials without team structure decisions
- ‚úÖ Knowledge work can proceed independently
- ‚úÖ Gap analysis helps inform better decisions

## Next Steps for AI Agents

**Immediate (Phase 1)**:
1. Complete project structure setup
2. Extract and organize research knowledge
3. Identify knowledge gaps
4. Prepare materials for user decisions

**Upcoming (Phase 2)**:
1. Fill any critical knowledge gaps
2. Finalize knowledge base for decision-making
3. Prepare user decision presentations

**Future (Phase 3+)**:
1. Present decision options to user
2. Create blueprint deliverables from decisions
3. Validate and enhance final outputs
