# Project: AI-SDLC Workflow Blueprint

## Project Context

**Project Type**: Implementation Blueprint
**Status**: Ready for Phase 4 - Blueprint Creation (Phase 3 Complete)
**Priority**: High

## Project Summary

Create a comprehensive, practical blueprint for implementing AI-assisted SDLC workflows that serves as the definitive guide for engineering teams to adopt AI in their development processes.

**Goals**: Provide Head of Engineering with complete implementation guidance including tool selection, team assignments, stage-by-stage procedures, and cost justification.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Visual workflow from business ideation to production
- Tool selection with reasoning and costs
- Stage-by-stage implementation guide with clear outcomes
- Setup procedures enabling complete AI workflow implementation

**Approach**: Systematic knowledge consolidation → user-agreed decisions → actionable deliverables

**Constraints**: All major decisions require explicit user agreement; no assumptions about preferences

## Current Status

**Progress**: All decisions complete - ready to create blueprint deliverables

**Active Tasks**: Phase 4 - Blueprint creation (visual diagrams, guides, procedures)

**No Blockers**: All prerequisites complete, ready for implementation

## Project Navigation System

### 🎯 Current Phase: Phase 4 - Blueprint Creation
**What you can do now**: Create all blueprint deliverables based on user decisions
**What's ready**: All decisions made (team, tools, SDLC stages)
**Next deliverables**: Visual diagrams, implementation guides, setup procedures, cost analysis

### 📁 Folder Navigation Guide

#### `/decisions/` - Finalized Decisions
- **Purpose**: Store ONLY user-agreed choices with confirmed reasoning
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All decisions documented
- **Contents**: Team structure, tool selection, SDLC stages decisions
- **Guide**: Read `/decisions/CLAUDE.md` for decision protocols

#### `/options/` - Decision Option Analyses
- **Purpose**: Research-based option evaluations and recommendations
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All option analyses available
- **Contents**: Infrastructure, testing, communication platform options
- **Guide**: Read `/options/CLAUDE.md` for option analysis protocols
- **Workflow**: Options → User Decision → Move to `/decisions/`

#### `/knowledge-base/` - Research Intelligence
- **Purpose**: Organized research findings ready for decision-making
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (all critical gaps filled, 6 knowledge files ready)
- **Current Work**: Ready for user decision presentations
- **Guide**: Read `/knowledge-base/CLAUDE.md` for research protocols

#### `/docs/` - Final Deliverables
- **Purpose**: Blueprint materials built from decisions + knowledge
- **Status**: Blocked until decisions are made
- **Dependencies**: Requires completed `/decisions/` folder
- **Guide**: Read `/docs/CLAUDE.md` for deliverable protocols

## AI Agent Instructions

### Phase-Based Working Pattern

**Phase 1 (COMPLETED)**: Foundation & Knowledge Work ✅
1. **Extract research knowledge** → work in `/knowledge-base/` ✅
2. **Identify gaps** → update gap analysis ✅
3. **Organize for decisions** → prepare decision-ready materials ✅
4. **No user input required** → work autonomously ✅

**Phase 2.1 (COMPLETED)**: Critical Gap Research ✅
1. **Fill critical gaps** → conduct additional research if needed ✅
2. **Security & compliance framework** → comprehensive research completed ✅
3. **Change management strategy** → full methodology developed ✅
4. **Integration requirements** → infrastructure analysis completed ✅
5. **Performance measurement** → KPI framework established ✅

**Phase 2.2 (COMPLETED)**: Knowledge Base Consolidation ✅
1. **Complete knowledge base** → finalize all analysis ✅
2. **Prepare decision materials** → ready for user review ✅

**Phase 3 (CURRENT)**: Decision Making (User Required)
1. **Present options** → use decision protocols
2. **Get explicit agreement** → document in `/decisions/`
3. **Track decision history** → maintain audit trail
4. **Wait for all decisions** before proceeding

**Phase 4**: Blueprint Creation
1. **Build from decisions** → use agreed choices only
2. **Create deliverables** → follow quality standards
3. **Validate completeness** → ensure user requirements met

### Quality Standards

**Decision Documentation**: Include reasoning, alternatives, and user confirmation
**Knowledge Organization**: Source citations, gap identification, decision-ready format
**Deliverable Creation**: Built from decisions + knowledge, validated for completeness

### Dependency Rules

- ❌ No tool guidance without tool selection decisions
- ❌ No workflow diagrams without process decisions  
- ❌ No training materials without team structure decisions
- ✅ Knowledge work can proceed independently
- ✅ Gap analysis helps inform better decisions

## Task Management

**Current Tasks**: Reference `task-list.md` for phase-specific implementation priorities and dependencies
**Progress Tracking**: Update `progress.md` with phase completion status and deliverable results
**Research Integration**: See `research-integration.md` for knowledge base applications and decision support

**Task Completion Protocol**:
1. **Mark Completed Tasks**: Update task status in `task-list.md` with completion timestamp and outcomes
2. **Document Progress**: Add detailed entries to `progress.md` with specific achievements and quality metrics
3. **Update Decision Status**: Track decision progress and user confirmations in decision audit trail
4. **Validate Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisites complete before advancing to next phase
5. **Cross-Reference Updates**: Verify all file references remain accessible and current

**Phase-Based Task Priorities**:
- **Phase 3 (Current)**: Decision-making tasks require user input and explicit confirmation
- **Phase 4 (Next)**: Blueprint creation tasks depend on completed decision documentation
- **Phase 5 (Future)**: Validation and enhancement tasks focus on deliverable quality

## Quick Navigation

- **Project Purpose**: See project-purpose.md for detailed goals
- **Current Tasks**: See task-list.md for work queue and dependencies
- **Progress Tracking**: See progress.md for accomplishments
- **Team Roles**: Defined in project-purpose.md stakeholder section
- **Enhancement Ideas**: Available in knowledge-base files and gap analysis

## Next Steps for AI Agents

**Immediate (Phase 3)**:
1. Present decision options to user using knowledge base
2. Get explicit agreement on team structure, tools, and processes
3. Document all decisions in `/decisions/` folder

**Upcoming (Phase 4)**:
1. Create blueprint deliverables from user decisions
2. Build implementation guides and visual diagrams
3. Validate completeness against user requirements

**Future (Phase 5)**:
1. Validate and enhance final outputs
2. Complete comprehensive implementation guide
3. Document lessons learned and optimization opportunities
