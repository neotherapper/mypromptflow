## Option 3: Hybrid Multi-Cloud Stack

**Core Philosophy**: Best-of-breed services from different providers.

### Platform Components

#### Version Control
- **GitHub**: For Claude integration and project management

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: For frontend deployment
- **Railway/Render**: For backend deployment

#### Hosting Platform
- **Vercel**: Frontend hosting and preview environments
- **Digital Ocean App Platform**: Backend API hosting
- **Cost-Effective**: Balance of features and price

#### Database
- **PlanetScale**: Serverless MySQL with branching
- **Alternative**: MongoDB Atlas for document needs

#### Monitoring
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **LogRocket**: Frontend user session recording

### Monthly Cost Estimate: $80-150
- Multiple smaller services instead of one large provider

---

## Option 4: GitLab Integrated Stack

**Core Philosophy**: Single platform for everything (if preferring alternative to GitHub).

### Platform Components

#### Version Control & CI/CD
- **GitLab**: Repository, CI/CD, project management, container registry
- **Trade-off**: Less Claude integration than GitHub
- **Cost**: Free tier available, Premium at $19/user/month

#### Hosting Platform
- **GitLab Pages**: Static site hosting
- **Google Cloud Run**: Backend API hosting
- **Heroku**: Alternative full-stack platform

#### Database
- **Google Cloud SQL**: Managed PostgreSQL
- **Cost**: $25-50/month

### Monthly Cost Estimate: $100-200
- GitLab Premium: $76/month (4 users)
- Hosting: $30-80/month
- Database: $25-40/month
