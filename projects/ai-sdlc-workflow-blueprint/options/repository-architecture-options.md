# Repository Architecture Options for AI-SDLC Workflow Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This document presents three primary repository architecture options for modern AI-assisted development workflows, based on comprehensive research and analysis. Each option is evaluated across multiple dimensions including AI tool integration, development workflow efficiency, and team collaboration patterns.

**Key Finding**: Git worktrees represent a breakthrough "third way" that combines the benefits of monorepos and polyrepos while optimizing for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Option 1: Traditional Monorepo Architecture (Baseline)

### Overview
Single repository containing all project code with unified build systems, shared dependencies, and coordinated release processes. Enhanced with modern tooling like NX for optimization.

├── main/                     # Production branch worktree
│   ├── CLAUDE.md            # Production context
│   ├── apps/
│   ├── libs/
│   └── docs/
├── develop/                  # Integration branch worktree
│   ├── CLAUDE.md            # Development context
│   └── [full project structure]
├── feature-auth/            # Feature branch worktree
│   ├── CLAUDE.md            # Feature-specific context
│   └── [focused on auth components]

└── experimental-ai/         # Experimental work
```

**Worktree Management Commands**:
```bash
# Initial setup
git clone --bare https://github.com/org/repo.git .bare
echo "gitdir: ./.bare" > .git

# Create worktrees
git worktree add main
git worktree add develop
git worktree add feature-auth origin/feature/authentication
git worktree add feature-payments -b feature/payments

# AI-optimized development
cd feature-auth && claude-code --context=auth-feature
cd feature-payments && claude-code --context=payments-feature
```

### Benefits
