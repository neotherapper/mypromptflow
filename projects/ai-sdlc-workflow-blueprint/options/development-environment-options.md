# Development Environment & Workflow Decision Options

## Decision Required: Development Environment Setup and Git Workflow

These decisions complement your infrastructure choice and define how your team will work day-to-day with the chosen platforms.

---

## Decision Category 1: Local Development Environment

### Option 1: Standardized Local Setup (RECOMMENDED)

**Philosophy**: Each developer has identical local environment setup.

#### Components
- **Node.js**: Specific version managed via `.nvmrc` file
- **Package Manager**: Single choice (npm/yarn/pnpm) across team
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL or Docker container
- **Environment Variables**: `.env.local` files with templates

#### Setup Process
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repo-url]
cd project

# Install Node.js version
nvm install && nvm use

# Install dependencies
[package-manager] install

# Setup local database
npm run db:setup

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Pros**:
- Simple onboarding for new team members
- Consistent behavior across all machines
- Works offline
- Full control over environment

**Cons**:
- Initial setup time per developer
- Maintenance of local dependencies
- Platform-specific issues possible

---

### Option 2: Docker Development Environment

**Philosophy**: Containerized development for perfect consistency.

#### Components
- **Docker Compose**: Full stack in containers
- **Dev Containers**: VS Code/Cursor integration
- **Shared Services**: Database, Redis, etc. in containers
- **Volume Mounts**: Code editing on host, execution in container

#### Setup Process
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repo-url]
cd project

# Start entire stack
docker-compose up -d

# Attach to development container
cursor --folder-uri vscode-remote://dev-container+...
```

**Pros**:
- Perfect environment consistency
- Quick onboarding (5 minutes)
- Includes all services (database, cache, etc.)
- Easy to add new services

**Cons**:
- Docker dependency and learning curve
- Potential performance overhead
- Complexity for simple projects

---

### Option 3: Cloud Development Environment

**Philosophy**: Development happens in the cloud with local IDE.

#### Options
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud-based VS Code environment
- **GitPod**: Cloud development with strong Git integration
- **CodeSandbox**: Browser-based development

#### Benefits
- **Zero Local Setup**: Works from any device
- **Consistent Environment**: Same for all developers
- **Powerful Hardware**: Cloud resources available
- **Instant Onboarding**: New developers productive immediately

**Costs**:
- GitHub Codespaces: $0.18/hour per 2-core machine
- Monthly estimate: $30-60 per developer
- Must factor into total budget

**Pros**:
- No local environment issues
- Perfect consistency
- Easy scaling of compute resources
- Great for remote team members

**Cons**:
- Ongoing cost
- Internet dependency
- Less familiar workflow

---

## Decision Category 2: Git Workflow Strategy

### Option 1: GitHub Flow (RECOMMENDED)

**Philosophy**: Simple branch-based workflow optimized for continuous deployment.

#### Workflow
```
main branch (always deployable)
    ↓
feature/task-123-user-auth
    ↓
Pull Request → Code Review → Merge → Deploy
```

#### Rules
- `main` branch is always deployable
- Feature branches for all changes
- Pull requests for all merges
- Automatic deployment from main

**Best For**: Small teams, frequent deployments, continuous delivery

---

### Option 2: Git Flow

**Philosophy**: Structured workflow with release branches and clear deployment cycles.

#### Workflow
```
main (production)
    ↓
develop (integration)
    ↓
feature/task-123 → release/v1.2.0 → main
```

#### Rules
- `main` contains production-ready code
- `develop` contains latest development changes
- Release branches for deployment preparation
- Hotfix branches for urgent production fixes

**Best For**: Teams wanting structured release cycles

---

### Option 3: Trunk-Based Development

**Philosophy**: Minimal branching with frequent commits to main.

#### Workflow
```
main branch (trunk)
    ↓
Short-lived feature branches (< 1 day)
    ↓
Frequent merges to main with feature flags
```

**Best For**: Advanced teams with strong CI/CD and feature flag systems

---

## Decision Category 3: Package Management

### Option 1: npm (Default)

**Standard Node.js package manager**
- **Pros**: Default, universal support, lockfile included
- **Cons**: Slower than alternatives, larger node_modules
- **Lockfile**: `package-lock.json`

### Option 2: Yarn

**Alternative package manager with enhanced features**
- **Pros**: Faster installs, better workspace support, plug-in architecture
- **Cons**: Additional tool to learn, some compatibility issues
- **Lockfile**: `yarn.lock`

### Option 3: pnpm

**Efficient package manager with content-addressed storage**
- **Pros**: Fastest installs, efficient disk usage, strict dependency handling
- **Cons**: Less common, learning curve, some edge case compatibility
- **Lockfile**: `pnpm-lock.yaml`

**Recommendation**: Start with npm unless team has specific needs

---

## Decision Category 4: Environment Management

### Option 1: Multiple Environment Strategy

#### Environments
1. **Development**: `localhost` or cloud dev environment
2. **Staging**: Production-like testing environment
3. **Production**: Live user environment

#### Deployment Flow
```
Development → Staging → Production
     ↓           ↓           ↓
  Feature    Integration   Live
   Testing     Testing    Traffic
```

### Option 2: Preview Environment Strategy

#### Environments
1. **Development**: Local development
2. **Preview**: Automatic environment per PR
3. **Production**: Live environment

#### Benefits
- Every PR gets testable URL
- No shared staging conflicts
- Easy client review and feedback

### Option 3: Branch-Based Environments

#### Strategy
- `main` → Production
- `develop` → Staging
- Feature branches → Preview environments

**Cost Consideration**: Preview environments can increase hosting costs

---

## Decision Category 5: Secret Management

### Option 1: Platform-Native Secrets

**GitHub**: GitHub Secrets for Actions
**Vercel**: Environment variables in dashboard
**Railway**: Built-in environment variable management

**Pros**: Simple, integrated, no additional tools
**Cons**: Platform lock-in, basic secret management

### Option 2: External Secret Management

**Options**:
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Enterprise-grade secret management
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Cloud-native secret storage
- **Azure Key Vault**: Microsoft cloud secret management

**Pros**: Advanced features, audit trails, rotation
**Cons**: Additional complexity and cost

### Option 3: Local + CI/CD Secrets

**Strategy**: 
- Local development: `.env` files (not committed)
- CI/CD: Platform secret management
- Production: Environment variables

**Recommended for small teams**: Simple and effective
