# AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence

## Overview

This project creates a comprehensive framework that teaches AI agents how to write concrete, accessible instructions that eliminate external dependencies while efficiently using internal project resources.

## Goals

- Extract specific behaviors from abstract framework references (SuperClaude, Claude Flow)
- Create guidelines for writing concrete, actionable instructions
- Develop self-sufficient instruction patterns that eliminate external research dependencies
- Build template library for different agent types
- Establish quality assessment framework for instruction effectiveness

## Current Status

**Progress**: 0% - Project initialization

**Priority**: High

## Key Information

**Approach**: Multi-phase development using parallel subagents for research and framework creation

**Success Criteria**: 
- Instructions contain specific steps instead of vague references
- All necessary context embedded without external dependencies
- Immediate actionability for AI agents
- Purpose-aligned instruction detail

**Constraints**: No simulation-based testing, focus on concrete assertion-based validation
