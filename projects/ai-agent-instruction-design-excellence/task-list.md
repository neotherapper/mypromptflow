## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Knowledge Extraction (Phase 1) → Framework Development (Phase 2)
2. Framework Development (Phase 2) → Template Creation (Phase 3)
3. Template Creation (Phase 3) → Implementation Guides (Phase 4)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- All Phase 1 tasks can run in parallel
- All Phase 2 tasks can run in parallel (after Phase 1)
- All Phase 3 tasks can run in parallel (after Phase 2)
- Phase 4 tasks can run in parallel (after Phase 3)

## Task Execution Notes

### Subagent Coordination
- Each subagent receives specific, self-contained instructions
- All necessary context embedded in subagent tasks
- Parallel execution for faster development
- Individual deliverables for each subagent

### Quality Standards
- All deliverables must contain concrete, specific instructions
- No vague references or external dependencies allowed
- Immediate actionability required for all templates
- Self-sufficiency validation for all frameworks

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 knowledge extraction with parallel subagent execution
2. Create project directory structure
3. Write comprehensive CLAUDE.md with all project context
4. Monitor subagent progress and deliverable creation
