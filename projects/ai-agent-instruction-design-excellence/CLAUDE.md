## AI Agent Instructions

### Understanding Claude and CLAUDE.md Files

**What is Claude?**
Claude is Anthropic's advanced AI assistant with sophisticated project understanding capabilities. Claude has:

**Automatic Context Loading System:**
- **Recursive File Discovery**: Claude automatically scans project directories for CLAUDE.md files
- **Hierarchical Context Loading**: Processes multiple CLAUDE.md files in order of specificity
- **Cross-Reference Resolution**: Understands @file_path references and loads referenced content automatically
- **Project Memory Persistence**: Maintains context across sessions within the same project

**Three-Tier Memory System:**
1. **Project Memory** (`./CLAUDE.md`): Team-shared architecture guidelines, coding standards, project workflows
2. **User Memory** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Personal preferences, development patterns, preferred libraries  
3. **Dynamic Memory Import**: Context-specific guidelines loaded based on current task requirements

**Advanced Project Intelligence:**
- **Multi-File Awareness**: Tracks relationships between files and modules across entire projects
- **Framework Recognition**: Deep understanding of React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, and other development frameworks
- **Cross-File Refactoring**: Can safely modify components, hooks, and utilities across related files
- **Build System Integration**: Native support for Vite, Webpack, and modern build systems

**Command System Integration:**
- **Dual Interface**: Commands serve both human users and AI agents through unified system
- **Automatic Execution**: Built-in command processing and workflow orchestration
- **File Navigation**: Direct file path references for workflow coordination
- **Registry Integration**: Automatic updates to YAML configuration files

**CLAUDE.md Best Practices:**
- **Provide Complete Project Context**: Include goals, constraints, success criteria, and current status
- **Define AI Agent Workflows**: Specify how agents should approach tasks and collaborate
- **Use Cross-Reference Patterns**: Leverage @file_path references for internal project navigation

### AI Agent Coordination Structure

**4-Level Agent Hierarchy for Framework Projects:**

**Level 1: Queen Agent (Master Coordinator)**
- **Authority**: Unlimited project authority and decision-making power
- **Responsibilities**: Strategic framework oversight, quality assurance, resource allocation
- **Coordination**: Reports directly to user, coordinates all lower-level agents
- **Time Intervals**: Continuous oversight with 15-minute checkpoint reviews

**Level 2: Architect Agents (System Designers)**  
- **Authority**: Domain design and high-level coordination within specialization
- **Responsibilities**: Framework architecture, assessment tool design, system integration
- **Coordination**: Report to Queen Agent every 15 minutes, coordinate with other Architects every 30 minutes
- **Task Limits**: Maximum 3 concurrent design tasks per Architect
- **Specializations**: Assessment Tools, Framework Design, Documentation Architecture, Validation Systems

**Level 3: Specialist Agents (Domain Experts)**
- **Authority**: Specialized analysis and implementation within domain expertise
- **Responsibilities**: Technical implementation, detailed analysis, domain-specific problem solving
- **Coordination**: Report to assigned Architect every 30 minutes, peer coordination every 60 minutes
- **Task Limits**: Maximum 5 concurrent tasks per Specialist
- **Specializations**: Concreteness Framework, Self-Sufficiency Framework, Purpose-Driven Framework, Actionable Framework, Quality Assessment

**Level 4: Worker Agents (Task Executors)**
- **Authority**: Specific task execution without spawning authority
- **Responsibilities**: File operations, documentation updates, validation procedures, testing execution
- **Coordination**: Report to assigned Specialist every 45 minutes, task completion updates continuous
- **Task Limits**: Maximum 10 concurrent tasks per Worker
- **Specializations**: File Analysis, Documentation Generation, Cross-Reference Validation, Quality Testing

**Coordination Protocols:**
- **Escalation Path**: Worker → Specialist → Architect → Queen for issues requiring higher authority
- **Decision Authority**: Queen (unlimited) → Architect (domain decisions) → Specialist (technical decisions) → Worker (execution decisions)
- **Communication Schedule**: 15/30/45 minute intervals based on hierarchy level
- **Quality Gates**: Each level validates work before passing to next level

## AI Agent Consumption Principles

**CRITICAL: This framework is designed specifically for AI agent consumption. All documentation must eliminate cognitive overhead patterns that provide zero actionable value for AI agents.**

### Core Optimization Rules

1. **Academic Overhead Elimination**: Remove "Research Foundation", "validated studies", academic justification sections that don't contribute to task execution
2. **Immediate Actionability**: Replace academic context with actionable configuration parameters and thresholds
3. **Token Efficiency**: Optimize content for AI agent consumption efficiency
4. **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Eliminate explanatory text that doesn't change AI agent behavior
5. **Zero External Dependencies**: All necessary context embedded in framework itself

### Detection Patterns for Cognitive Overhead

**Flag for removal when assessing AI agent instructions:**
- ✗ "Research Foundation", "based on validated studies", academic justification sections
- ✗ Credibility building language ("research-proven", "comprehensive analysis")
- ✗ Performance benchmarks without actionable thresholds
- ✗ Background context that doesn't influence execution decisions
- ✗ Explanatory text providing academic rationale rather than implementation guidance

### Transformation Pattern

**Before (Academic Overhead)**:
```markdown
## Research Foundation
Based on validated research findings and comprehensive analysis of AI agent performance patterns...

## Research-Proven Performance
Configuration demonstrates effectiveness across multiple domains...
```

**After (AI Agent Optimized)**:
```markdown
**Tool Configuration**: ≥85 points for production deployment
**Timeout Configuration**: 30-60 second thresholds, exponential backoff enabled
**Circuit Breaker**: 3 failure threshold, 60s timeout, 300s recovery
**Success Criteria**: ≥90% functionality preservation required
```

### Working Patterns

**Preferred Approach** (Actionable Specifications):
- **Use Parallel Subagents**: Spawn multiple agents simultaneously to reduce total project time compared to sequential execution
- **Focus on Concrete Patterns**: Replace abstract descriptions with specific parameters, numerical thresholds, and measurable criteria (target: 0 subjective qualifiers)
- **Implement Progressive Context Loading**: Use docs/ structure for efficient context optimization
- **Validate for Immediate Actionability**: Ensure instructions executable by AI agents within 5-8 minutes without additional interpretation (≥4/5 Executability score required)
- **Optimize Internal References**: Maintain 100% cross-reference accuracy with 0 external dependencies (verified through Self-Sufficiency Framework assessment)

**Quality Standards** (Concrete Definitions):
- **Concrete and Specific Instructions**: Parameters defined with exact values, numerical thresholds, and measurable criteria (scoring target: ≥4/5 on Specificity dimension)
- **External Dependencies Eliminated**: Zero requirements for web searches, external APIs, or uncontrolled documentation (scoring target: ≥4/5 on Self-Sufficiency dimension)  
- **Progressive Context Loading Optimized**: Internal references enable efficient context optimization
- **Knowledge Base Accessibility Verified**: All referenced files exist and are accessible within project structure (100% cross-reference accuracy required)
- **Immediate Actionability**: Instructions executable by AI agents within 5-8 minutes without additional interpretation (scoring target: ≥4/5 on Executability dimension)
- **Self-Sufficiency Validation**: Complete project context embedded, no external knowledge dependencies (validation checklist must pass 100%)

**Things to Avoid**: 
- Vague references like "SuperClaude patterns" or "Claude Flow behaviors"
- Instructions requiring external research or web searches
- Abstract concepts without specific implementation steps
- Simulation-based testing approaches
- Broken internal references or inaccessible knowledge files

### Progressive Documentation Navigation

**When users ask about instruction improvement or framework application:**

1. **Use Progressive Documentation**: Direct users to docs/README.md for navigation
2. **Apply Framework Selection**: Use decision trees to select appropriate framework
3. **Load Context Efficiently**: Use progressive loading to minimize token usage
4. **Integrate with Knowledge Base**: Reference knowledge/ for detailed techniques

**Example Query Responses**:

```
User: "How do I fix this vague instruction?"
Response: "Start with the progressive documentation navigation at docs/README.md. Based on your instruction, you likely need the Concreteness Framework:
1. Load docs/design-principles/concreteness/overview.md for assessment
2. Apply the 2-minute assessment to identify specific issues
3. Load docs/design-principles/concreteness/techniques.md for transformation patterns
4. See docs/design-principles/concreteness/examples.md for before/after examples
This progressive approach reduces context load while providing targeted guidance."

User: "My instruction references external frameworks. How do I fix it?"
Response: "This indicates a self-sufficiency issue. Navigate to docs/design-principles/self-sufficiency/overview.md to:
1. Assess external dependencies using the 3-minute assessment
2. Learn about progressive context loading patterns
3. Apply elimination techniques from docs/design-principles/self-sufficiency/techniques.md
4. See internal reference optimization examples
Total context load: 800-1,200 lines vs 2,300+ lines from full framework."

User: "What orchestration patterns should I use?"
Response: "For orchestration patterns, reference knowledge/orchestration/queen-patterns.md for comprehensive details. For progressive loading approach, see docs/design-principles/purpose-driven/overview.md which covers:
- 4-level agent hierarchy with specific coordination patterns
- Progressive context loading based on complexity
- Internal reference optimization for efficiency
- Integration with knowledge base techniques"
```

**Progressive Documentation Guidelines**:
- Always start with docs/README.md for navigation
- Use framework-specific modules for targeted context loading
- Reference knowledge/ for comprehensive technique documentation
- Apply progressive loading for context optimization
