# Project: AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence

## Project Context

**Project Type**: Framework Development
**Status**: Active - Phase 1 Knowledge Extraction
**Priority**: High

## Project Summary

This project creates a comprehensive framework that teaches AI agents how to write concrete, accessible instructions that eliminate external dependencies while efficiently using internal project resources. The goal is to eliminate problems like "implement patterns from SuperClaude and Claude Flow v2.0.0" by extracting the specific behaviors and creating accessible internal knowledge systems.

**Goals**: 
- Extract concrete behaviors from abstract framework references
- Create progressive context loading patterns for efficient instruction design
- Build comprehensive knowledge base with all techniques and orchestration patterns
- Establish quality assessment framework with internal reference optimization

**Success Criteria**: 
- Instructions contain specific steps instead of vague references
- External dependencies eliminated, internal references optimized
- Progressive context loading reduces token usage by 60-70%
- Knowledge base enables intelligent technique discovery
- Immediate actionability for AI agents
- Purpose-aligned instruction detail

**Approach**: Multi-phase development using parallel subagents for research and framework creation

**Constraints**: 
- No simulation-based testing, focus on concrete assertions
- Eliminate external dependencies (web searches, external APIs, uncontrolled documentation)
- Enable efficient internal references within project
- All techniques and patterns must be accessible in knowledge base

## Current Status

**Progress**: 5% - Project initialization complete, beginning Phase 1

**Active Tasks**: 
- Create directory structure
- Spawn Phase 1 research subagents
- Begin knowledge extraction

**Blockers**: None currently identified

## AI Agent Instructions

### How to Work on This Project

1. **Read Context First**: Review project-purpose.md for detailed goals and scope
2. **Check Tasks**: Look at task-list.md for current priorities and status
3. **Review Research**: Check research-integration.md for relevant knowledge and gaps
4. **Use Progressive Documentation**: Access docs/README.md for navigation and efficient context loading
5. **Update Progress**: Document your work in progress.md
6. **Manage Tasks**: Update task-list.md when completing or adding tasks

### Working Patterns

**Preferred Approach**: 
- Use parallel subagents for faster development
- Focus on concrete, specific patterns over abstract descriptions
- Implement progressive context loading from knowledge base
- Validate for immediate actionability and internal reference efficiency

**Quality Standards**: 
- All instructions must be concrete and specific
- External dependencies eliminated (no web searches, external APIs, uncontrolled documentation)
- Internal references optimized for progressive context loading
- Knowledge base accessibility verified
- Immediate actionability required
- Self-sufficiency validation mandatory

**Things to Avoid**: 
- Vague references like "SuperClaude patterns" or "Claude Flow behaviors"
- Instructions requiring external research or web searches
- Abstract concepts without specific implementation steps
- Simulation-based testing approaches
- Broken internal references or inaccessible knowledge files

### Progressive Documentation Navigation

**When users ask about instruction improvement or framework application:**

1. **Use Progressive Documentation**: Direct users to docs/README.md for navigation
2. **Apply Framework Selection**: Use decision trees to select appropriate framework
3. **Load Context Efficiently**: Use progressive loading to minimize token usage
4. **Integrate with Knowledge Base**: Reference knowledge/ for detailed techniques

**Example Query Responses**:

```
User: "How do I fix this vague instruction?"
Response: "Start with the progressive documentation navigation at docs/README.md. Based on your instruction, you likely need the Concreteness Framework:
1. Load docs/design-principles/concreteness/overview.md for assessment
2. Apply the 2-minute assessment to identify specific issues
3. Load docs/design-principles/concreteness/techniques.md for transformation patterns
4. See docs/design-principles/concreteness/examples.md for before/after examples
This progressive approach reduces context load by 60-70% while providing targeted guidance."

User: "My instruction references external frameworks. How do I fix it?"
Response: "This indicates a self-sufficiency issue. Navigate to docs/design-principles/self-sufficiency/overview.md to:
1. Assess external dependencies using the 3-minute assessment
2. Learn about progressive context loading patterns
3. Apply elimination techniques from docs/design-principles/self-sufficiency/techniques.md
4. See internal reference optimization examples
Total context load: 800-1,200 lines vs 2,300+ lines from full framework."

User: "What orchestration patterns should I use?"
Response: "For orchestration patterns, reference knowledge/orchestration/queen-patterns.md for comprehensive details. For progressive loading approach, see docs/design-principles/purpose-driven/overview.md which covers:
- 4-level agent hierarchy with specific coordination patterns
- Progressive context loading based on complexity
- Internal reference optimization for efficiency
- Integration with knowledge base techniques"
```

**Progressive Documentation Guidelines**:
- Always start with docs/README.md for navigation
- Use framework-specific modules for targeted context loading
- Reference knowledge/ for comprehensive technique documentation
- Apply progressive loading to achieve 60-70% context reduction

### Progressive Documentation Usage

**How to use the progressive documentation structure:**

1. **Start with Navigation Hub**: Always begin at docs/README.md
2. **Apply Decision Trees**: Use problem-solution mapping to select frameworks
3. **Load Progressive Modules**: Load only needed modules (60-70% context reduction)
4. **Reference Knowledge Base**: Use knowledge/ for comprehensive technique details

**Framework Selection Process:**
- **Vague language** → [Concreteness Framework](docs/design-principles/concreteness/overview.md)
- **External dependencies** → [Self-Sufficiency Framework](docs/design-principles/self-sufficiency/overview.md)
- **Unclear objectives** → [Purpose-Driven Framework](docs/design-principles/purpose-driven/overview.md)
- **Not executable** → [Actionable Framework](docs/design-principles/actionable/overview.md)

**Context Loading Efficiency:**
- Traditional monolithic files: 2,300+ lines per framework
- Progressive loading: 700-1,400 lines total (targeted modules)
- Typical reduction: 60-70% fewer tokens while maintaining comprehensive coverage

### Progress Tracking

**After completing any task, update these files:**
1. **progress.md**: Add accomplishment with specific details
2. **task-list.md**: Mark tasks as completed and add new discovered tasks
3. **TodoWrite tool**: Update task status to "completed"

### Quality Validation

**Before marking any task complete, verify:**
- All deliverables contain specific, actionable instructions
- No vague references or external dependencies
- All necessary context is embedded
- Instructions are immediately executable by AI agents

## Quick Navigation

- **Project Purpose**: See project-purpose.md for detailed goals
- **Current Tasks**: See task-list.md for work queue  
- **Progress Tracking**: See progress.md for accomplishments

## Next Steps for AI Agents

1. **Use Progressive Documentation**: Start with docs/README.md for navigation and framework selection
