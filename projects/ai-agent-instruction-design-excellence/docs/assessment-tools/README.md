## Tool Integration Error Workflows

### AI Agent Multi-Tool Assessment Pattern

For comprehensive framework assessment, AI agents must execute multiple tools in sequence with proper error handling:

```yaml
multi_tool_assessment_workflow:
  sequence:
    1. framework_coherence_analyzer
    2. communication_pattern_validator  
    3. workflow_completeness_inspector
    4. constitutional_ai_compliance_checker
    5. resilience_assessment_engine
    6. context_optimization_tool
    7. multi_agent_coordination_dashboard
    
  error_handling:
    circuit_breaker_pattern:
      failure_threshold: 3 # tool failures before circuit opens
      timeout_duration: 300 # seconds per tool
      recovery_timeout: 600 # seconds before retry
      
    timeout_handling:
      per_tool_timeout: 600 # seconds
      total_workflow_timeout: 3600 # seconds
      timeout_action: "proceed_with_partial_results"
      
    error_recovery:
      tool_failure_action: "log_and_continue"
      cascade_prevention: true
      partial_results_acceptable: true
      minimum_tools_required: 4 # out of 7
```

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

**Tool Failure Circuit Breaker:**
```python
def execute_assessment_tool_with_circuit_breaker(tool_name, framework_path, config):
    """Execute assessment tool with circuit breaker protection"""
    
    circuit_breaker = get_circuit_breaker(tool_name)
    
    if circuit_breaker.is_open():
        return {
            "status": "circuit_open",
            "message": f"Circuit breaker open for {tool_name}",
            "fallback_result": get_cached_result(tool_name, framework_path)
        }
    
    try:
        with timeout(config.per_tool_timeout):
            result = execute_tool(tool_name, framework_path, config)
            circuit_breaker.record_success()
            return {"status": "success", "result": result}
            
    except TimeoutError:
        circuit_breaker.record_failure()
        return {
            "status": "timeout", 
            "message": f"{tool_name} exceeded {config.per_tool_timeout}s timeout",
            "action": "proceed_with_partial_assessment"
        }
        
    except ToolExecutionError as e:
        circuit_breaker.record_failure()
        return {
            "status": "tool_error",
            "message": f"{tool_name} execution failed: {e}",
            "action": "log_error_and_continue"
        }
```

### Error Recovery Procedures

**Cascade Failure Prevention:**
1. **Tool Isolation**: Each tool failure isolated to prevent cascade
2. **Partial Results**: Accept partial assessment results from successful tools
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide meaningful results even with tool failures
4. **Error Aggregation**: Collect and report all tool errors systematically

**Recovery Actions:**
- **Tool Timeout**: Log timeout, use cached results if available, continue with remaining tools
- **Tool Crash**: Log error details, mark tool as failed, continue assessment workflow
- **Configuration Error**: Report configuration issue, skip tool, continue with valid tools
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Implement backoff strategy, retry with reduced resource allocation

### Workflow Completeness Validation

**Pre-Assessment Validation:**
```bash
# Validate tool availability and configuration
./assessment-suite validate-tools --framework-path /path/to/framework --required-tools 4

# Check resource availability
./assessment-suite check-resources --memory-limit 2GB --timeout-budget 3600s

# Verify framework accessibility
./assessment-suite verify-framework --path /path/to/framework --read-test
```

**Post-Assessment Validation:**
```bash
# Validate assessment completeness
./assessment-suite validate-results --minimum-tools 4 --required-scores coherence,communication,workflow,constitutional

# Generate comprehensive report with partial results
./assessment-suite generate-report --handle-missing-tools --partial-results-acceptable
```

### Error Handling Examples

**Example 1: Tool Timeout Recovery**
```
Tool: framework-coherence-analyzer
Status: TIMEOUT (exceeded 600s)
Action: Using cached coherence analysis from previous run
Impact: Assessment continues with 6/7 tools completed
Result: 85% assessment confidence (above 80% threshold)
```

**Example 2: Circuit Breaker Activation**
```
Tool: context-optimization-tool  
Status: CIRCUIT_OPEN (3 consecutive failures)
Action: Skipping optimization analysis, using default recommendations
Impact: Assessment continues with optimization scored as "needs_attention"
Result: Overall assessment valid, optimization section flagged for manual review
```

**Example 3: Graceful Degradation**
```
Tools Failed: resilience-assessment-engine, multi-agent-coordination-dashboard
Tools Successful: 5/7 (coherence, communication, workflow, constitutional, context)
Action: Generate assessment report with resilience section marked as incomplete
Result: 78% assessment confidence, recommend re-running failed tools separately
```
