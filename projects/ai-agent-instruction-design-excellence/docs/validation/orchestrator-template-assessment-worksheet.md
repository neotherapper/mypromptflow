# Framework Orchestrator Template Assessment Worksheet

## Step 1: Analyze the Problem Instruction (30 seconds)

**Target File**: `/docs/template-library/orchestrator-templates/framework-orchestrator-template.md`
**Assessment Date**: 2025-07-18
**Methodology**: Framework Selector from `docs/navigation/framework-selector.md`

### 1. Vagueness Detection Checklist

**Looking for vague terms, missing parameters, subjective measures:**

- [x] **Contains vague terms**: 
  - Line 8: "dynamic mesh topology" (no definition provided)
  - Line 9: "systematic optimization strategies" (no specific strategies listed)
  - Line 15: "proven Queen-agent coordination patterns" (no proof metrics)
  - Line 61: "optimally" (no optimization criteria)
  - Line 64: "optimal agent utilization patterns" (no definition of optimal)

- [ ] **Missing specific parameters**: 
  - Most parameters are well-defined (percentages, time intervals, thresholds)
  - Specific metrics provided (70%+ token reduction, 84%+ success rate)

- [ ] **Uses subjective measures**: 
  - Limited subjective language, mostly quantified

**VAGUENESS DETECTED: MINIMAL** (3-4 instances found, but generally well-specified)

### 2. Purpose Clarity Assessment

**Looking for unclear goals, missing roles, no hierarchy:**

- [ ] **Unclear end goals**: Clear objectives stated (lines 15-20) with specific metrics
- [ ] **Missing agent roles**: Detailed 4-level hierarchy defined (lines 79-120)
- [ ] **No coordination structure**: Comprehensive coordination structure provided (lines 124-149)
- [ ] **Ambiguous outcomes**: Specific success metrics and quality gates defined

**PURPOSE CLARITY ISSUES: NONE** (Clear structure and objectives)

### 3. Dependency Analysis

**Looking for external systems, unexplained frameworks, required research:**

- [x] **References external systems**: 
  - Line 5: References `/research/findings/meta-frameworks-analysis/comprehensive-analysis.md`
  - Line 7: "Claude Flow v2.0.0" mentioned with performance metrics
  - Line 9: "SuperClaude" referenced for optimization strategies

- [x] **Mentions frameworks without explanation**: 
  - Line 7: "Claude Flow v2.0.0" - external framework referenced
  - Line 9: "SuperClaude" - external framework referenced
  - Line 8: "dynamic mesh topology" - concept not explained

- [ ] **Requires web searches**: 
  - No web search requirements

**EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES: MODERATE** (References external frameworks and research)

### 4. Executability Assessment

**Looking for interpretation requirements, missing procedures, unclear criteria:**

- [ ] **Requires interpretation**: 
  - Instructions are generally specific with clear parameters
  - YAML configurations provide exact specifications
  - Time intervals and thresholds clearly defined

- [ ] **Missing step-by-step procedures**: 
  - Detailed hierarchy structure provided
  - Coordination schedules specified
  - Quality gates with specific criteria

- [ ] **No clear success criteria**: 
  - Clear success metrics (70%+, 84%+, 99%, >95%)
  - Quality gates with specific thresholds
  - Validation methods specified

**EXECUTABILITY ISSUES: MINIMAL** (Generally clear and specific)

## Step 2: Framework Selection Logic

**Based on checklist results above:**

- **Vagueness detected**: MINIMAL → Concreteness Framework not primary need
- **Purpose unclear**: NONE → Purpose-Driven Framework not needed  
- **External dependencies**: MODERATE → Self-Sufficiency Framework recommended
- **Not executable**: MINIMAL → Actionable Framework not primary need

**Primary issue detected**: External dependencies

**Framework Recommendation**: **Self-Sufficiency Framework**
**Expected Context Load**: 800-1,000 lines (moderate transformation needed)

## Step 3: 30-Second Assessment Protocol

**Applying exact scoring criteria (0-5 scale):**

### Specificity Assessment (Weight: 25%)
**Analyzing parameter definition and exactness:**

- **Specific elements**: Percentages (70%+, 84%+), time intervals (15 min, 30 min), task limits (max 3, max 5)
- **Some vague terms**: "optimal", "systematic", "dynamic mesh topology"
- **Assessment**: Most parameters specific, minor ambiguity

**Score: 4/5** (Most parameters specific, minor ambiguity)

### Executability Assessment (Weight: 25%)  
**Analyzing immediate execution capability:**

- **Clear procedures**: YAML configurations, hierarchy structure, coordination schedules
- **Minimal interpretation**: Most instructions are immediately executable
- **Assessment**: Mostly executable, minor clarification needed

**Score: 4/5** (Mostly executable, minor clarification needed)

### Self-Sufficiency Assessment (Weight: 20%)
**Analyzing external dependencies:**

- **External references**: Claude Flow v2.0.0, SuperClaude, external research file
- **Some dependencies**: References external frameworks for context
- **Assessment**: Some external dependencies, manageable

**Score: 3/5** (Some external dependencies, manageable)

### Purpose Clarity Assessment (Weight: 20%)
**Analyzing objectives and success criteria:**

- **Crystal clear objectives**: Specific metrics, detailed hierarchy, clear roles
- **Clear success criteria**: Quality gates with thresholds
- **Assessment**: Crystal clear objectives and success criteria

**Score: 5/5** (Crystal clear objectives and success criteria)

### Completeness Assessment (Weight: 10%)
**Analyzing information gaps:**

- **Comprehensive information**: Configuration details, coordination schedules, quality frameworks
- **Minor gaps**: Some external framework concepts not defined
- **Assessment**: Minor information gaps

**Score: 4/5** (Minor information gaps)

## Quality Score Calculation

**Using exact formula:**
```
Quality Score = (Specificity × 0.25) + (Executability × 0.25) + (Self-Sufficiency × 0.20) + (Purpose × 0.20) + (Completeness × 0.10)
Quality Score = (4 × 0.25) + (4 × 0.25) + (3 × 0.20) + (5 × 0.20) + (4 × 0.10)
Quality Score = 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.60 + 1.00 + 0.40
Quality Score = 4.0/5
```

**Assessment Result**: **4.0/5 - Excellent - Minor optimization needed**

## Specific Issues Identified

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **External Framework Dependencies**: References to Claude Flow v2.0.0 and SuperClaude without full context
2. **Undefined Technical Terms**: "dynamic mesh topology" lacks definition
3. **External Research Dependency**: References research file that may not be accessible

### Low Priority Issues  
1. **Minor Vague Terms**: "optimal", "systematic" could be more specific
2. **External Context Assumption**: Assumes familiarity with referenced frameworks

## Recommended Improvements

### Apply Self-Sufficiency Framework
- Replace external framework references with specific behavior descriptions
- Define "dynamic mesh topology" within the template
- Embed key research insights rather than referencing external files

### Minor Concreteness Improvements
- Define "optimal agent utilization patterns" with specific criteria
- Specify what "systematic optimization strategies" entails
- Add definition for "proven coordination patterns"

## Comparison with CLAUDE.md Assessment

**Orchestrator Template Performance**:
- **Higher overall score**: 4.0/5 vs 3.5/5 for CLAUDE.md
- **Better specificity**: 4/5 vs 3/5 (more quantified parameters)
- **Better purpose clarity**: 5/5 vs 4/5 (clearer hierarchy and roles)
- **Similar self-sufficiency**: 3/5 vs 4/5 (some external dependencies)
- **Better executability**: 4/5 vs 3/5 (more detailed procedures)

**Key Differences**:
- Orchestrator template is more structured and specific
