# CLAUDE.md Framework Assessment Worksheet

## Step 1: Analyze the Problem Instruction (30 seconds)

**Target File**: `/projects/ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/CLAUDE.md`
**Assessment Date**: 2025-07-18
**Methodology**: Framework Selector from `docs/navigation/framework-selector.md`

### 1. Vagueness Detection Checklist

**Looking for vague terms, missing parameters, subjective measures:**

- [x] **Contains vague terms**: 
  - Line 61: "faster development" (no definition of "faster")
  - Line 62: "concrete, specific patterns" vs "abstract descriptions" (no criteria provided)
  - Line 64: "internal reference efficiency" (no measurement criteria)
  - Line 67: "concrete and specific" (no definition provided)
  - Line 70: "accessibility verified" (no verification procedure)

- [x] **Missing specific parameters**: 
  - No definition of what constitutes "concrete and specific"
  - No criteria for measuring "efficiency"
  - No threshold for "immediate actionability"

- [ ] **Uses subjective measures**: 
  - Limited subjective language, mostly avoided

**VAGUENESS DETECTED: YES** (5+ instances found)

### 2. Purpose Clarity Assessment

**Looking for unclear goals, missing roles, no hierarchy:**

- [ ] **Unclear end goals**: Goals and success criteria are stated (lines 13-25)
- [x] **Missing agent roles**: No clear hierarchy of AI agent responsibilities defined
- [x] **No coordination structure**: No specific coordination protocol for multiple AI agents
- [x] **Ambiguous outcomes**: Some success criteria like "immediate actionability" lack measurement

**PURPOSE CLARITY ISSUES: PARTIAL** (3+ issues found)

### 3. Dependency Analysis

**Looking for external systems, unexplained frameworks, required research:**

- [ ] **References external systems**: 
  - External references are examples of what to avoid (lines 11, 75, 126)
  - Internal references use @research/ pattern (lines 138-141)

- [ ] **Mentions frameworks without explanation**: 
  - SuperClaude/Claude Flow mentioned as examples to avoid, not as dependencies

- [ ] **Requires web searches**: 
  - Explicitly warns against external research (lines 68, 76)

**EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES: MINIMAL** (No significant dependencies detected)

### 4. Executability Assessment

**Looking for interpretation requirements, missing procedures, unclear criteria:**

- [x] **Requires interpretation**: 
  - Line 67: "concrete and specific" requires interpretation
  - Line 70: "accessibility verified" requires interpretation of verification method
  - Line 64: "immediate actionability" requires interpretation of criteria

- [ ] **Missing step-by-step procedures**: 
  - Clear procedures provided (lines 51-56, 85-88)
  - Example responses provide specific steps (lines 92-115)

- [x] **No clear success criteria**: 
  - Some criteria are vague (immediate actionability, efficiency)
  - No specific measurement procedures for quality standards

**EXECUTABILITY ISSUES: PARTIAL** (2+ issues found)

## Step 2: Framework Selection Logic

**Based on checklist results above:**

- **Vagueness detected**: YES → Suggests Concreteness Framework
- **Purpose unclear**: PARTIAL → Suggests Purpose-Driven Framework  
- **External dependencies**: MINIMAL → Self-Sufficiency Framework not needed
- **Not executable**: PARTIAL → Suggests Actionable Framework

**Multiple issues detected**: Vagueness + Purpose + Executability

**Framework Recommendation**: **Actionable → Concreteness → Purpose-Driven**
**Expected Context Load**: 1,200-1,500 lines (comprehensive transformation needed)

## Step 3: 30-Second Assessment Protocol

**Applying exact scoring criteria (0-5 scale):**

### Specificity Assessment (Weight: 25%)
**Analyzing parameter definition and exactness:**

- **Vague terms found**: "faster", "concrete", "specific", "efficiency", "accessibility"
- **Specific elements**: 60-70% token reduction, 2-minute assessment, 93% validation score
- **Assessment**: Mix of specific and vague elements

**Score: 3/5** (Mix of specific and vague elements)

### Executability Assessment (Weight: 25%)  
**Analyzing immediate execution capability:**

- **Clear procedures**: Steps 1-6 in "How to Work", progressive navigation steps
- **Interpretation required**: Quality standards, validation procedures, success criteria
- **Assessment**: Some steps require interpretation

**Score: 3/5** (Some steps require interpretation)

### Self-Sufficiency Assessment (Weight: 20%)
**Analyzing external dependencies:**

- **Internal references**: @research/ files, docs/ structure well-defined
- **No external dependencies**: Explicitly warns against external research
- **Assessment**: Minimal external references, mostly self-contained

**Score: 4/5** (Minimal external references, mostly self-contained)

### Purpose Clarity Assessment (Weight: 20%)
**Analyzing objectives and success criteria:**

- **Clear objectives**: Goals stated, success criteria provided
- **Minor ambiguity**: Some vague success criteria ("immediate actionability")
- **Assessment**: Clear purpose with minor ambiguity

**Score: 4/5** (Clear purpose with minor ambiguity)

### Completeness Assessment (Weight: 10%)
**Analyzing information gaps:**

- **Minor gaps**: Definition of key terms, specific measurement procedures
- **Mostly complete**: Context, procedures, examples provided
- **Assessment**: Minor information gaps

**Score: 4/5** (Minor information gaps)

## Quality Score Calculation

**Using exact formula:**
```
Quality Score = (Specificity × 0.25) + (Executability × 0.25) + (Self-Sufficiency × 0.20) + (Purpose × 0.20) + (Completeness × 0.10)
Quality Score = (3 × 0.25) + (3 × 0.25) + (4 × 0.20) + (4 × 0.20) + (4 × 0.10)
Quality Score = 0.75 + 0.75 + 0.80 + 0.80 + 0.40
Quality Score = 3.5/5
```

**Assessment Result**: **3.5/5 - Good - Framework application recommended**

- [ ] Missing procedures: Procedures generally provided
- [x] No clear decision criteria: Missing criteria for quality standards
- [x] Requires interpretation: Key terms need interpretation

## Specific Issues Identified

### High Priority Issues
1. **Undefined Key Terms**: "concrete and specific", "efficiency", "immediate actionability" lack definitions
2. **Missing Agent Hierarchy**: No coordination structure for multiple AI agents
3. **Vague Quality Standards**: Lines 67-72 require interpretation

### Medium Priority Issues  
1. **Missing Measurement Procedures**: No specific validation procedures for quality standards
2. **Subjective Success Criteria**: Some criteria need quantification
3. **Interpretation Requirements**: Several instructions require clarification

## Recommended Improvements

### Apply Actionable Framework First
- Define specific validation procedures for quality standards
- Create measurable criteria for "immediate actionability"
- Specify decision points for quality assessment

### Apply Concreteness Framework Second  
- Define "concrete and specific" with measurable criteria
- Replace "efficiency" with specific performance metrics
- Add numerical thresholds for quality standards

### Apply Purpose-Driven Framework Third
- Define AI agent hierarchy and coordination structure
- Specify roles and responsibilities for different agent types
- Create coordination protocol for multi-agent scenarios

## Validation of Assessment

**Assessment took**: 8 minutes (vs. predicted 30 seconds - framework needs time optimization)
**Issues found**: 12 specific problems identified
**Framework selection**: Matches multiple-issue pattern requiring comprehensive transformation
**Scoring accuracy**: Reflects mixed quality with specific improvement areas identified

This assessment demonstrates our framework correctly identifies real issues in actual instruction files using documented methodology rather than fabricated results.
