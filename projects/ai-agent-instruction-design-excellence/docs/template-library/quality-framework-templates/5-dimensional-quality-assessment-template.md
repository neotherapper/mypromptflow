## Quality Dimensions and Weightings

### Core 5-Dimensional Framework
1. **Accuracy (25%)** - Factual correctness, technical precision, data integrity
2. **Consistency (25%)** - Internal coherence, cross-reference alignment, standardization
3. **Completeness (25%)** - Comprehensive coverage, requirement fulfillment, gap analysis
4. **Clarity (15%)** - Communication effectiveness, readability, actionability
5. **Relevance (10%)** - Stakeholder alignment, contextual appropriateness, value delivery

### Weighting Rationale
- **Equal weighting (25% each)** for Accuracy, Consistency, and Completeness reflects their critical importance for system reliability
- **Clarity (15%)** addresses communication effectiveness while maintaining technical rigor
- **Relevance (10%)** ensures stakeholder alignment without compromising objective quality standards

## Constitutional AI Integration

### Ethical Principles Framework
- **Human autonomy preservation** - Ensure human decision-making authority remains paramount
- **Fairness and non-discrimination** - Eliminate bias in assessment criteria and scoring
- **Transparency and explainability** - Provide clear reasoning for all quality judgments
- **Privacy and data protection** - Safeguard sensitive information throughout assessment process
- **Accountability and responsibility** - Maintain clear attribution for quality decisions

### Compliance Requirements
- All assessments must pass constitutional AI validation before finalization
- Ethical review checkpoints integrated at each dimensional assessment
- Bias detection and mitigation protocols active throughout evaluation
- Human oversight mandatory for high-stakes quality determinations

## Multi-Agent Validation Protocol

### 99% Accuracy Achievement Process

#### Phase 1: Independent Assessment (3 Agents)
1. **Agent A**: Primary quality assessor using full 5-dimensional framework
2. **Agent B**: Secondary assessor focusing on consistency and completeness validation
3. **Agent C**: Challenge agent identifying potential quality gaps and edge cases

#### Phase 2: Consensus Building
1. **Automated comparison** of independent assessments across all dimensions
2. **Discrepancy analysis** for scores varying by >10% between agents
3. **Evidence synthesis** combining strengths from each agent's evaluation
4. **Consensus scoring** through weighted average with outlier adjustment

#### Phase 3: Validation Verification
1. **Cross-validation** against established quality benchmarks
2. **Consistency check** with similar assessments in knowledge base
3. **Stakeholder alignment** verification for relevance dimension
4. **Final accuracy confirmation** through systematic review process

### Agent Coordination Protocol
- **Parallel execution** for time efficiency (2.5 minute target)
- **Shared evidence base** ensuring consistent information access
- **Standardized scoring matrices** eliminating inter-agent variability
- **Automated conflict resolution** through evidence-weighted averaging
