## Best Practices

### Template Customization
1. **Preserve Core Framework**: Maintain the 5-dimensional structure and weightings
2. **Adapt Context Parameters**: Customize criteria and thresholds for your specific domain
3. **Maintain Evidence Standards**: Keep evidence-based validation requirements
4. **Integrate Stakeholder Needs**: Incorporate stakeholder-specific requirements

### Implementation Success Factors
1. **Multi-Agent Deployment**: Implement coordinated multi-agent validation for maximum accuracy
2. **Constitutional Integration**: Include constitutional AI validation for ethical compliance
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish ongoing quality monitoring and improvement processes
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Maintain active stakeholder involvement and feedback integration

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Single-Agent Assessment**: Avoid relying on single-agent validation (92% accuracy vs 99% multi-agent)
2. **Subjective Scoring**: Maintain quantitative, evidence-based scoring methodologies
3. **Isolated Assessment**: Ensure cross-document coherence validation for system-level quality
4. **Static Thresholds**: Implement dynamic threshold adjustment based on performance and feedback
