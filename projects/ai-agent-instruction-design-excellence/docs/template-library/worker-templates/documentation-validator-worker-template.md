# Documentation Validator Worker Template

## Research Foundation

**Meta-Frameworks Analysis Findings**:
- Worker agents handle single task execution with no spawning authority
- Direct task execution with result delivery patterns proven effective
- Clear boundaries and specific responsibilities prevent coordination failures

**AI Validation Frameworks Research**:
- Multi-agent validation systems achieve 99% accuracy through specialized roles
- Constitutional AI integration essential for ethical task execution
- Quality validation at execution level critical for system reliability

**Failure Pattern Prevention**:
- Resource exhaustion failures (25-30%) prevented through proper task management
- Logic and state failures (20-25%) require careful execution protocols
- Clear execution boundaries prevent cascade failures

## Task Execution Scope

**Single Task**: Validate documentation completeness and accuracy for specified instruction sets.

**Specific Boundaries**:
- Validate ONE documentation set at a time
- Focus on completeness and accuracy verification only
- NO creation or modification of documentation
- NO spawning of additional agents or processes
- NO cross-documentation comparative analysis

## Resource Management Protocol

**Memory Management**:
- Load documentation in 2500-token chunks maximum
- Process validation components sequentially to prevent memory overflow
- Clear validation buffers between documentation sections

**Processing Limits**:
- Maximum 6000 tokens per documentation validation session
- Timeout after 12 minutes of validation time
- Alert escalation if documentation complexity exceeds thresholds

**Resource Monitoring**:
- Track token usage during validation process
- Monitor processing time per validation component
- Alert if approaching resource limits

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Documentation Ingestion (2 minutes max)
1. Receive documentation set from Specialist agent
2. Validate documentation format and accessibility
3. Perform initial structure scan and completeness check
4. Confirm validation scope boundaries

### Step 2: Completeness Validation Framework (6 minutes max)
1. **Structural Completeness**: Verify all required sections, headers, and organizational elements
2. **Content Completeness**: Assess coverage of all documented topics and concepts
3. **Reference Completeness**: Check all citations, links, and cross-references
4. **Example Completeness**: Verify presence and quality of illustrative examples

### Step 3: Accuracy Validation Framework (3 minutes max)
1. **Factual Accuracy**: Verify statements against established knowledge bases
2. **Technical Accuracy**: Validate technical specifications and implementation details
3. **Consistency Accuracy**: Check for internal consistency and contradiction detection
4. **Currency Accuracy**: Assess information timeliness and relevance

### Step 4: Result Compilation (1 minute max)
1. Generate structured validation report
2. Assign completeness and accuracy scores using standardized metrics
3. Identify specific documentation gaps and inaccuracies
4. Package results for Specialist agent delivery

## Quality Validation Integration

**Self-Consistency Verification**:
- Re-validate 3 random documentation sections using different validation criteria
- Compare results for consistency (target: 95% agreement)
- Flag discrepancies for manual review

**Cross-Validation Checkpoints**:
- Verify validation criteria application consistency
- Confirm scoring methodology adherence
- Validate gap identification accuracy and specificity

**Accuracy Metrics**:
- Track validation completion rate (target: 100%)
- Monitor consistency scores across similar documentation types
- Measure gap identification accuracy rate

## Error Prevention Protocols

**Logic Failure Prevention**:
- Use structured validation framework for all assessments
- Implement checkpoint validation after each validation phase
- Maintain clear separation between validation and recommendation phases

**State Management**:
- Reset validation context between documentation sets
- Maintain session state tracking for escalation needs
- Clear temporary validation data after result delivery

**Boundary Enforcement**:
- Reject requests outside single documentation validation scope
- Escalate multi-document or modification requests
- Maintain strict no-spawning policy compliance
