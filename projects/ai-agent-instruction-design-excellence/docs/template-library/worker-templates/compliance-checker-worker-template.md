# Compliance Checker Worker Template

## Research Foundation

**Meta-Frameworks Analysis Findings**:
- Worker agents handle single task execution with no spawning authority
- Direct task execution with result delivery patterns proven effective
- Clear boundaries and specific responsibilities prevent coordination failures

**AI Validation Frameworks Research**:
- Multi-agent validation systems achieve 99% accuracy through specialized roles
- Constitutional AI integration essential for ethical task execution
- Quality validation at execution level critical for system reliability

**Failure Pattern Prevention**:
- Resource exhaustion failures (25-30%) prevented through proper task management
- Logic and state failures (20-25%) require careful execution protocols
- Clear execution boundaries prevent cascade failures

## Task Execution Scope

**Single Task**: Check Constitutional AI and ethical compliance for specified instruction implementations.

**Specific Boundaries**:
- Check ONE instruction set for compliance at a time
- Focus on ethical and Constitutional AI validation only
- NO modification or optimization of instructions
- NO spawning of additional agents or processes
- NO comparative compliance analysis across different instruction sets

## Resource Management Protocol

**Memory Management**:
- Load instruction content in 2000-token chunks maximum
- Process compliance checks sequentially to prevent memory overflow
- Clear compliance buffers between instruction evaluations

**Processing Limits**:
- Maximum 4500 tokens per compliance check session
- Timeout after 10 minutes of compliance checking time
- Alert escalation if compliance complexity exceeds thresholds

**Resource Monitoring**:
- Track token usage during compliance checking process
- Monitor processing time per compliance component
- Alert if approaching resource limits

## Execution Instructions

## Error Prevention Protocols

**Logic Failure Prevention**:
- Use structured compliance framework for all assessments
- Implement checkpoint validation after each compliance phase
- Maintain clear separation between compliance checking and recommendation phases

**State Management**:
- Reset compliance evaluation context between instruction sets
- Maintain session state tracking for escalation needs
- Clear temporary compliance data after result delivery

**Boundary Enforcement**:

2. **Ethical Compliance**: "Bias detection: 60/100 - potential cultural bias in content evaluation. Fairness: 70/100 - may disadvantage certain groups. Privacy: 95/100 - strong privacy protections. Safety: 80/100 - good safety measures."

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: "Content standards: 90/100 - adheres to guidelines. Accessibility: 85/100 - mostly accessible. Legal: 80/100 - generally compliant. Industry: 90/100 - follows best practices."

4. **Risk Assessment**: "High risk: Cultural bias in content evaluation. Medium risk: Potential over-censorship. Low risk: Privacy violations."

5. **Remediation Plan**: "Immediate: Implement bias testing. Short-term: Develop cultural sensitivity training. Long-term: Regular bias audits."

**Result**: Overall compliance score 78/100 with specific recommendations for bias mitigation and cultural sensitivity improvements.

**Delivery**: Structured report delivered to Specialist agent within 9 minutes, using 3,800 tokens, maintaining all boundary conditions.
