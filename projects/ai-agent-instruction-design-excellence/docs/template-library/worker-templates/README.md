# Worker Agent Instruction Templates

## Overview

This directory contains research-validated worker agent instruction templates implementing proven task execution patterns. Worker agents handle single task execution with no spawning authority, delivering direct results to Specialist agents.

## Research Foundation

These templates are based on comprehensive research findings from:

- **Meta-Frameworks Analysis**: Worker agents handle single task execution with clear boundaries
- **AI Validation Frameworks Research**: Multi-agent validation systems achieve 99% accuracy through specialized roles
- **AI Agent Failure Pattern Research**: Prevention of resource exhaustion (25-30%) and logic failures (20-25%)

## Worker Templates Available

## Common Template Features

### Resource Management Protocol
- **Memory Management**: Token-based chunk processing to prevent overflow
- **Processing Limits**: Time-based timeouts with escalation procedures
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of token usage and processing time

### Quality Validation Integration
- **Self-Consistency Verification**: Re-testing with different approaches for 95% agreement
- **Cross-Validation Checkpoints**: Methodology consistency verification
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Completion rate and consistency tracking

### Error Prevention Protocols
- **Logic Failure Prevention**: Structured frameworks with checkpoint validation
- **State Management**: Clean separation between execution phases
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Strict no-spawning policy compliance

### Constitutional AI Compliance
- **Ethical Principles Integration**: Respect for human autonomy and beneficial outcomes
- **Bias Prevention**: Standardized criteria application across all instruction types
- **Safety Considerations**: Identification and escalation of harmful content

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Worker Templates
- **Single Task Execution**: When you need specialized execution of one specific task
- **Direct Result Delivery**: When results need to be delivered directly to Specialist agents
- **Boundary Enforcement**: When clear execution boundaries are critical
- **Resource Management**: When resource exhaustion prevention is essential

### Integration with Agent Hierarchy
- **Orchestrator Level**: Orchestrators coordinate but do not use worker templates directly
- **Specialist Level**: Specialists assign specific tasks to workers using these templates
- **Worker Level**: Workers execute using these templates with no spawning authority

### Template Customization
- **Core Structure**: Maintain the research-validated core structure
- **Domain Adaptation**: Adapt specific criteria and metrics to domain requirements
- **Boundary Conditions**: Preserve strict boundary enforcement mechanisms
- **Resource Limits**: Adjust resource limits based on specific implementation needs

## Implementation Best Practices

### Resource Management
- **Token Budgeting**: Allocate token budgets based on task complexity
- **Time Management**: Set realistic time limits with escalation procedures
- **Memory Optimization**: Use sequential processing to prevent memory overflow

### Quality Assurance
- **Validation Standards**: Maintain 95% accuracy targets across all worker operations
- **Consistency Monitoring**: Track performance consistency across similar tasks
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error prevention and recovery mechanisms

### Boundary Enforcement
- **Scope Limitation**: Strictly enforce single task execution boundaries
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear escalation paths for out-of-scope requests
- **No-Spawning Policy**: Maintain zero tolerance for unauthorized agent spawning

## Performance Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 95% minimum across all worker operations
- **Consistency**: 95% minimum across similar task types
- **Completion Rate**: 100% of assigned tasks completed within scope

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Resource Utilization**: 85% efficiency in token usage
- **Processing Time**: Within defined time limits for each template
- **Error Rate**: <5% in task execution processes

### Success Criteria
- **Boundary Compliance**: Zero boundary violations or spawning attempts
- **Constitutional AI Compliance**: 100% compliance maintained
- **Result Delivery**: Complete reports for 100% of requests

## Research Validation
