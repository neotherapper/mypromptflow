# Framework Orchestrator Template

## Configuration Requirements

Based on systematic framework patterns (embedded for self-sufficiency):

- **Queen-Agent Coordination Patterns**: Master coordinator with unlimited spawning authority manages hierarchical agent swarms using these specific behaviors:
  - Continuous oversight with 15-minute checkpoint reviews
  - Final decision authority on all strategic framework decisions
  - Direct coordination of Architect-level agents with task distribution
  - Quality gate enforcement with validation authority
  - Resource allocation optimization with performance monitoring
  - Implementation: Systematic coordination through validated checkpoint procedures

- **4-Level Hierarchical Agent Structure**: Self-organizing coordination system with distributed mesh connectivity:
  - **Dynamic Mesh Topology**: Agents maintain direct communication channels with all peers in adjacent hierarchy levels plus indirect channels through hierarchy for escalation
  - **Unlimited Agent Swarms**: No hard limits on agent spawning, with intelligent resource allocation based on task complexity
  - **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breaker patterns with timeout and retry configurations through redundant agent assignments
  - **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous pattern optimization based on coordination effectiveness metrics

- **Token Optimization Strategies**: Systematic reduction techniques through progressive loading:
  - **UltraCompressed Mode**: Progressive loading using symbol notation and abbreviated syntax
  - **Progressive Detail Levels**: Basic/moderate/comprehensive detail selection based on context complexity
  - **Shared Context Pools**: Reusable context libraries reducing redundant information loading
  - **Dynamic Compression Triggers**: Automatic compression activation when context usage >75% threshold
  - **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligent content segmentation with systematic functionality preservation

- **Multi-Agent Coordination Protocols**: Advanced coordination through systematic validation:
  - **Cross-Validation Protocols**: Independent verification by multiple agents before decision finalization
  - **Consensus Building**: Majority vote systems for complex decisions with Queen override authority
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time coordination effectiveness tracking with adjustment triggers
  - **Conflict Resolution**: Automated escalation paths with defined authority levels for dispute resolution

- **Constitutional AI Integration**: Ethical compliance framework ensuring comprehensive coverage:
  - **5-Principle Validation**: Accuracy, Transparency, Completeness, Responsibility, Integrity enforcement
  - **Bias Detection**: Automated bias scanning across 7 dimensions with correction protocols
  - **Auditability**: 100% decision traceability with comprehensive logging and review capabilities

## Template Objectives

- Token optimization through systematic progressive loading
- Systematic problem-solving through hierarchical coordination
- Validation accuracy through multi-agent cross-checking
- Comprehensive ethical compliance through constitutional AI
- Scalable evaluation across unlimited framework domains
