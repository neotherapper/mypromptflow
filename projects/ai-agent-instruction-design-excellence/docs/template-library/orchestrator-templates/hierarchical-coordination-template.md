# Hierarchical Coordination Template

## Research Foundation

Based on meta-frameworks research findings and Queen-agent coordination patterns:

- **Queen→Architect→Specialist→Worker hierarchy** from Claude Flow v2.0.0 achieving 84.8% SWE-Bench solve rate
- **Unlimited agent swarms** with dynamic hierarchical mesh topology
- **Fault tolerance and automatic recovery** with <100ms recovery time
- **Load balancing efficiency** at 96% through hierarchical coordination
- **Dynamic agent architecture** with self-organizing capabilities

## Template Objectives

Create a hierarchical coordination orchestrator that implements proven Queen-agent patterns to achieve:
- 84%+ problem-solving success rate through hierarchical coordination
- 96% load balancing efficiency across agent hierarchies
- <100ms fault recovery time with automatic agent replacement
- Unlimited scaling through dynamic mesh topology
- Self-organizing agent coordination with adaptive learning
