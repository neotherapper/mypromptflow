# 5-Dimension Assessment Calculator

## Purpose

Automated calculation and scoring for the 5-dimensional framework assessment to accelerate evaluation from 6-8 minutes to 2-3 minutes while maintaining accuracy and preventing fictional assessments.

## Anti-Fiction Validation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: This tool requires actual checklist application - no estimation or fabrication permitted.

- ✅ **MUST apply documented checklists to real file content**
- ✅ **MUST calculate scores using documented mathematical formulas**
- ✅ **MUST show step-by-step calculation with actual numbers**
- ✅ **MUST validate scoring against threshold criteria**
- ❌ **CANNOT estimate scores without checklist application**
- ❌ **CANNOT create fictional percentage scores**
