# Checklist Application Automator

## Purpose

Automated application of framework checklists with evidence collection and gap identification to accelerate assessment while maintaining accuracy and preventing fictional results.

## Anti-Fiction Validation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: This tool requires actual checklist item validation - no estimation or fabrication permitted.

- ✅ **MUST apply each checklist item to actual file content**
- ✅ **MUST provide specific line references for all findings**
- ✅ **MUST collect real evidence quotes from file**
- ✅ **MUST document completion percentage with actual counts**
- ❌ **CANNOT mark checklist items as passed without evidence**
- ❌ **CANNOT create fictional completion percentages**

## Automated Checklist Processing

  validation_criteria:
    passed_item_requirements:
      - evidence_quote: "Actual text from file that satisfies criteria"
      - line_number: "Specific line where evidence found"
