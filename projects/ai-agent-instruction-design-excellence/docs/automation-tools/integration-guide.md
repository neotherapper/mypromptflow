# Automation Tools Integration Guide

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for integrating all five automation tools to achieve 2-3 minute framework assessments while maintaining accuracy and preventing fictional results.

## Integration Overview

### Tool Integration Architecture
```yaml
integration_architecture:
  sequential_workflow:
    tool_1: "vagueness-detector.md - Analyze vague terms and specificity"
    tool_2: "dependency-scanner.md - Identify external dependencies"
    tool_3: "checklist-automator.md - Apply framework checklists systematically"
    tool_4: "assessment-calculator.md - Calculate dimensional scores and final rating"
    tool_5: "report-generator.md - Generate comprehensive assessment report"
    
  parallel_optimization:
    phase_1_concurrent: "vagueness-detector + dependency-scanner (can run simultaneously)"
    phase_2_dependent: "checklist-automator (requires phase 1 outputs)"
    phase_3_calculation: "assessment-calculator (requires checklist results)"
    phase_4_reporting: "report-generator (requires all previous outputs)"
    
  data_flow:
    vagueness_data: "Feeds into specificity dimension of assessment-calculator"
    dependency_data: "Feeds into self-sufficiency dimension of assessment-calculator"
    checklist_data: "Provides evidence and completion percentages to assessment-calculator"
