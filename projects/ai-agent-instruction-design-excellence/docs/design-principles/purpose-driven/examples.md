}
```

### Pattern 2: Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Implementation Example**: Automatic resource reallocation based on demand

```
RESOURCE ALLOCATION ALGORITHM:

QUEEN AGENT DECISION LOGIC:
function allocateResources(systemMetrics, demandForecast) {
  const totalCapacity = calculateTotalCapacity();
  const currentAllocation = getCurrentAllocation();
  const projectedDemand = demandForecast.next_4_hours;
  
  // Calculate optimal allocation
  const optimalAllocation = {
    data_processing: Math.min(projectedDemand.data_volume * 0.4, totalCapacity * 0.6),
    quality_control: Math.min(projectedDemand.quality_checks * 0.3, totalCapacity * 0.2),
    storage_management: Math.min(projectedDemand.storage_ops * 0.2, totalCapacity * 0.15),
    system_coordination: totalCapacity * 0.05
  };
  
  // Implement gradual reallocation
  return gradualReallocation(currentAllocation, optimalAllocation, 0.2);
}

ARCHITECT AGENT COORDINATION:
function coordinateReallocation(newAllocation, currentState) {
  const reallocationPlan = {
    phase1: {
      duration: "5 minutes",
      actions: [
        "notify_specialists_of_pending_changes",
        "prepare_worker_migration_plans"
      ]
    },
    phase2: {
      duration: "10 minutes",
      actions: [
        "begin_gradual_worker_migration",
        "monitor_performance_impact"
      ]
    },
    phase3: {
      duration: "15 minutes",
      actions: [
        "complete_resource_reallocation",
        "validate_new_performance_levels"
      ]
    }
  };
  
  return executeReallocationPlan(reallocationPlan);
}
```

### Pattern 3: Cross-Domain Coordination

**Implementation Example**: Multi-domain task coordination with dependencies

```
CROSS-DOMAIN COORDINATION FLOW:

TASK DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
{
  "task_id": "ecommerce_order_12345",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "domain": "inventory",
      "specialist": "inventory_specialist_01",
      "task": "reserve_items",
      "estimated_duration": "2 seconds",
      "priority": "high"
    },
    {
      "domain": "payment",
      "specialist": "payment_specialist_01",
      "task": "process_payment",
      "estimated_duration": "3 seconds",
      "priority": "high",
      "depends_on": ["reserve_items"]
    },
    {
      "domain": "fulfillment",
      "specialist": "fulfillment_specialist_01",
      "task": "prepare_shipping",
      "estimated_duration": "30 seconds",
      "priority": "medium",
      "depends_on": ["process_payment"]
    }
  ]
}

COORDINATION PROTOCOL:
1. Architect Agent receives order processing request
2. Dependency graph analyzed and execution plan created
3. Parallel execution of independent tasks (inventory reservation)
4. Sequential execution of dependent tasks (payment after inventory)
5. Status monitoring and progress tracking across domains
6. Error handling and rollback procedures for failed dependencies
7. Success confirmation and completion reporting
```

### Example 2: Performance Optimization

**Scenario**: Continuous performance improvement through learning

```
PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK:

LEARNING ALGORITHM:
function optimizePerformance(historicalData, currentMetrics) {
  const patterns = analyzePerformancePatterns(historicalData);
  const bottlenecks = identifySystemBottlenecks(currentMetrics);
  const optimizations = generateOptimizationPlan(patterns, bottlenecks);
  
  return {
    agent_reallocation: optimizations.agent_distribution,
    workflow_adjustments: optimizations.process_improvements,
    resource_optimization: optimizations.resource_usage,
    coordination_enhancements: optimizations.communication_patterns
  };
}

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS:
1. Performance data collection across all hierarchy levels
2. Pattern analysis and bottleneck identification
3. Optimization plan generation and validation
4. Gradual implementation with performance monitoring
5. Results evaluation and feedback integration
