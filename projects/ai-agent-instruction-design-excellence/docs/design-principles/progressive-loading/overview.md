# Progressive Loading Framework Overview

## Quick Assessment: Is This Your Problem?

**Use this framework if your instructions have these characteristics:**

✗ **Monolithic knowledge embedding** - Single instruction contains knowledge for multiple domains  
✗ **Always-loaded patterns** - Large knowledge blocks loaded regardless of actual needs  
✗ **Multiple specialization areas** - Single agent handles diverse, unrelated expertise  
✗ **Conditional scenarios ignored** - Same knowledge loaded for all execution paths  
✗ **Token inefficiency** - High token usage with low utilization rates  
✗ **Domain knowledge mixing** - TypeScript + Python + Docker + etc. validation in one place

**If 3+ items match your instruction, this framework will transform it to progressive, efficient knowledge loading.**

## What This Framework Does

**Core Principle**: Transform monolithic instructions into thin coordinators that spawn specialized agents with domain-specific knowledge, loaded only when needed.

**Transformation Process**:
1. **Assess loading efficiency** using token utilization analysis
2. **Identify knowledge domains** through specialization boundary detection
3. **Apply coordinator-specialist patterns** for conditional knowledge loading
4. **Validate efficiency gains** through scenario-based token analysis
5. **Optimize for conditional execution** with minimal coordinator overhead

## Framework Components

### 1. Progressive Loading Assessment System

**Token Efficiency Analysis**:
- **Utilization Rate** (40% weight): Knowledge actually used vs. loaded knowledge
- **Specialization Boundaries** (30% weight): Distinct domain expertise areas
- **Conditional Scenarios** (20% weight): Different execution paths requiring different knowledge
- **Coordinator Overhead** (10% weight): Minimal coordination logic vs. embedded knowledge

**Efficiency Score Calculation**:
```
Efficiency_Score = (Utilization_Rate × 0.40) + (Specialization_Boundaries × 0.30) + 
                   (Conditional_Scenarios × 0.20) + (Coordinator_Overhead × 0.10)
```

**Score Interpretation**:
- **0.85-1.00**: Highly Efficient (excellent progressive loading)
- **0.70-0.84**: Moderately Efficient (minor optimization opportunities)
- **0.55-0.69**: Somewhat Inefficient (significant progressive loading needed)
- **0.00-0.54**: Highly Inefficient (major coordinator-specialist restructuring required)

### 2. Knowledge Domain Identification

**Specialization Boundary Detection**:
- **File Type Domains**: TypeScript, Python, YAML, etc. requiring distinct validation knowledge
- **Functional Domains**: Security, performance, testing, documentation requiring specialized expertise
- **Context Domains**: Frontend, backend, DevOps, API requiring different environmental knowledge
- **Tool Domains**: ESLint, pytest, Docker, etc. requiring tool-specific knowledge

**Domain Independence Testing**:
```yaml
domain_independence_criteria:
  knowledge_overlap: "Minimal shared knowledge between domains (<20%)"
  execution_independence: "Domains can execute without others' knowledge"
  specialization_depth: "Domain knowledge requires focused expertise"
  conditional_usage: "Domains used only when relevant files/scenarios detected"
```

### 3. Coordinator-Specialist Architecture Patterns

**Thin Coordinator Pattern**:
```yaml
coordinator_responsibilities:
  discovery: "Detect relevant domains in current context"
  routing: "Spawn appropriate specialists based on detection"
  aggregation: "Collect and synthesize specialist results"
  minimal_knowledge: "Only coordination logic, no domain expertise"
  
coordinator_characteristics:
  token_count: "50-100 lines maximum"
  domain_knowledge: "Zero embedded domain expertise"
  decision_logic: "Simple routing based on detection patterns"
  spawning_authority: "Can spawn unlimited specialists as needed"
```

**Domain Specialist Pattern**:
```yaml
specialist_responsibilities:
  focused_expertise: "Deep knowledge in single domain only"
  self_contained: "All necessary domain knowledge embedded"
  conditional_loading: "Loaded only when domain detected"
  parallel_execution: "Independent execution without cross-domain dependencies"
  
specialist_characteristics:
  token_count: "50-400 lines based on domain complexity"
  knowledge_scope: "Single domain expertise only"
  execution_pattern: "Receive inputs, apply domain knowledge, return results"
  coordination: "Report to coordinator, minimal peer interaction"
```

### 4. Progressive Loading Transformation Techniques

**Available in [techniques.md](techniques.md)**:
1. **Knowledge Domain Extraction** - Identify and separate distinct expertise areas
2. **Coordinator Minimization** - Reduce coordination logic to essential routing only
3. **Specialist Creation** - Extract domain knowledge into focused agents
4. **Conditional Spawning Logic** - Implement detection-based agent spawning
5. **Token Optimization** - Calculate and optimize token efficiency gains
6. **Discovery Integration** - Connect with existing asset discovery systems
7. **Parallel Execution Design** - Enable independent specialist execution
8. **Result Aggregation** - Synthesize specialist outputs effectively
9. **Caching Optimization** - Reuse specialists across similar contexts
10. **Progressive Enhancement** - Add new specialists without coordinator changes

## Quick Progressive Loading Assessment

**Use this 5-minute assessment:**

### Step 1: Token Utilization Analysis (2 minutes)
For your instruction, calculate:
- **Total Knowledge Lines**: Count all domain knowledge in instruction: ___
- **Always Used Lines**: Knowledge used in every execution: ___
- **Conditionally Used Lines**: Knowledge used only in specific scenarios: ___
- **Utilization Rate**: (Always Used / Total) × 100 = ___%

### Step 2: Domain Boundary Identification (2 minutes)
Count distinct knowledge domains in your instruction:
- [ ] File type expertise (TypeScript, Python, etc.) - Count: ___
- [ ] Functional expertise (security, testing, etc.) - Count: ___
- [ ] Tool expertise (ESLint, Docker, etc.) - Count: ___
- [ ] Context expertise (frontend, backend, etc.) - Count: ___

### Step 3: Efficiency Calculation (1 minute)
**Monolithic Penalty**: (Domain Count - 1) × 0.1 = ___
**Utilization Score**: Utilization Rate / 100 = ___
**Progressive Loading Score**: Utilization Score - Monolithic Penalty = ___

## Transformation Examples
