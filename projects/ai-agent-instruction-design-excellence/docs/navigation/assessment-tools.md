## Quick Quality Score Calculator

### 30-Second Assessment Protocol

**Instructions**: Rate each dimension 0-5, calculate weighted score

#### 1. Specificity Assessment (Weight: 25%)
- **5**: All parameters defined with exact values and thresholds
- **4**: Most parameters specific, minor ambiguity
- **3**: Mix of specific and vague elements
- **2**: Mostly vague with some specific elements
- **1**: Primarily vague language
- **0**: Completely abstract or theoretical

#### 2. Executability Assessment (Weight: 25%)
- **5**: Immediately executable without interpretation
- **4**: Mostly executable, minor clarification needed
- **3**: Some steps require interpretation
- **2**: Many steps need clarification
- **1**: Significant interpretation required
- **0**: Cannot execute without major rewriting

#### 3. Self-Sufficiency Assessment (Weight: 20%)
- **5**: No external dependencies, all context internal
- **4**: Minimal external references, mostly self-contained
- **3**: Some external dependencies, manageable
- **2**: Multiple external dependencies
- **1**: Heavy reliance on external resources
- **0**: Completely dependent on external systems

#### 4. Purpose Clarity Assessment (Weight: 20%)
- **5**: Crystal clear objectives and success criteria
- **4**: Clear purpose with minor ambiguity
- **3**: Generally clear with some uncertainty
- **2**: Somewhat unclear objectives
- **1**: Vague or confusing purpose
- **0**: No clear purpose defined

#### 5. Completeness Assessment (Weight: 10%)
- **5**: All necessary information provided
- **4**: Minor information gaps
- **3**: Some important information missing
- **2**: Several key elements missing
- **1**: Major gaps in information
- **0**: Severely incomplete

### Scoring Calculation

**Formula**: 
```
Quality Score = (Specificity × 0.25) + (Executability × 0.25) + (Self-Sufficiency × 0.20) + (Purpose × 0.20) + (Completeness × 0.10)
```

**Scoring Thresholds**:
- **4.0-5.0**: Excellent - Minor optimization needed
- **3.0-3.9**: Good - Framework application recommended
- **2.0-2.9**: Fair - Significant improvement required
- **1.0-1.9**: Poor - Major restructuring needed
- **0.0-0.9**: Critical - Complete rewrite required

## Problem Identification Matrix

### Common Instruction Problems

**Use this checklist to identify specific issues:**

#### Vagueness Indicators
- [ ] Contains terms: "effectively", "efficiently", "appropriately", "properly"
- [ ] Uses subjective measures: "good", "better", "optimal", "high quality"
- [ ] Missing numerical thresholds or specific parameters
- [ ] Includes qualifiers: "some", "several", "various", "multiple"

#### External Dependency Indicators  
- [ ] References: "SuperClaude", "Claude Flow", "industry standards", "best practices"
- [ ] Mentions: "external API", "third-party", "web search", "latest information"
- [ ] Requires: "research", "documentation lookup", "external validation"

#### Purpose Clarity Indicators
- [ ] Missing success criteria or end goals
- [ ] Unclear agent roles or responsibilities
- [ ] No coordination or hierarchy defined
- [ ] Ambiguous about desired outcomes

#### Executability Indicators
- [ ] Uses abstract verbs: "coordinate", "manage", "optimize", "handle"
- [ ] Missing step-by-step procedures
- [ ] No clear decision criteria or validation methods
- [ ] Requires interpretation or clarification

## Rapid Assessment Examples

### Example 1: Quick Vagueness Check
**Instruction**: "Monitor system performance regularly and optimize when necessary"

**Assessment**:
- Specificity: 1/5 (No specific metrics, "regularly" undefined, "when necessary" vague)
- Executability: 1/5 (Cannot execute without clarification)
- Self-Sufficiency: 4/5 (No external dependencies)
- Purpose: 2/5 (General optimization goal, unclear success criteria)
- Completeness: 2/5 (Missing monitoring intervals, optimization triggers)

**Score**: (1×0.25) + (1×0.25) + (4×0.20) + (2×0.20) + (2×0.10) = 2.1/5
**Assessment**: Poor - Major restructuring needed
**Recommended Framework**: Actionable → Concreteness

### Example 2: Quick Dependency Check
**Instruction**: "Implement SuperClaude optimization patterns for better system performance"

**Assessment**:
- Specificity: 2/5 (Some specific reference, vague outcomes)
- Executability: 1/5 (Cannot execute without external knowledge)
- Self-Sufficiency: 1/5 (Heavy external dependency on "SuperClaude patterns")
- Purpose: 2/5 (Optimization goal, unclear success metrics)
- Completeness: 2/5 (Missing implementation details)

**Score**: (2×0.25) + (1×0.25) + (1×0.20) + (2×0.20) + (2×0.10) = 1.55/5
**Assessment**: Poor - Major restructuring needed
**Recommended Framework**: Self-Sufficiency → Concreteness

## Integration with Framework Selection

### Assessment-to-Framework Mapping

**Based on lowest-scoring dimensions:**

**Specificity ≤ 2**: → [Concreteness Framework](../design-principles/concreteness/overview.md)
**Executability ≤ 2**: → [Actionable Framework](../design-principles/actionable/overview.md)  
**Self-Sufficiency ≤ 2**: → [Self-Sufficiency Framework](../design-principles/self-sufficiency/overview.md)
**Purpose ≤ 2**: → [Purpose-Driven Framework](../design-principles/purpose-driven/overview.md)

### Multi-Framework Selection Logic

**Multiple low scores (≤ 2):**
- **Specificity + Executability**: Actionable → Concreteness
- **Self-Sufficiency + Specificity**: Self-Sufficiency → Concreteness  
- **Purpose + Executability**: Purpose-Driven → Actionable
- **3+ dimensions ≤ 2**: Use [Implementation Paths](implementation-paths.md) for systematic approach
