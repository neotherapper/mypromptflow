# Content Management - Daily Workflows

## How to Work with Your Content

Your AI Notion MCP Integration system gives you two ways to manage your content: through files on your computer and through Notion's interface. Both approaches work together seamlessly, so you can choose the method that works best for each task.

## Adding New Content

### Method 1: Creating Content in Files

**Best for**: Technical content, detailed documentation, version-controlled information

**Steps**:
1. **Navigate to your knowledge folder** on your computer
2. **Create a new markdown file** with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-tool-analysis.md`)
3. **Add the required metadata** at the top of your file:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Your Content Title"
   category: "Tools" # or Frameworks, Research, etc.
   priority: "High" # High, Medium, or Low
   status: "Draft" # Draft, In Progress, Complete
   created_date: "2025-07-21"
   ---
   ```
4. **Write your content** using standard markdown formatting
5. **Save the file** - the system will automatically sync it to Notion within a few minutes

### Method 2: Creating Content in Notion

**Best for**: Quick updates, collaborative editing, visual organization

**Steps**:
1. **Open your Notion workspace** and navigate to the relevant database (Tools, Frameworks, or Research)
2. **Click "New" or "+" to create a new page**
3. **Fill in the properties** using the sidebar (Category, Priority, Status, etc.)
4. **Add your content** using Notion's rich text editor
5. **The system will sync changes** back to your files automatically

## Editing Existing Content

### Understanding the Two-Way Sync

Your system maintains perfect synchronization between files and Notion:
- **Changes in files** appear in Notion within 2-3 minutes
- **Changes in Notion** update your files automatically
- **Conflicts are rare** but when they happen, file changes take priority

### Editing in Files

**When to use**: Complex formatting, code examples, bulk changes

1. **Open your file** in your preferred text editor
2. **Make your changes** using markdown syntax
3. **Save the file** - changes sync automatically
4. **Check Notion** after a few minutes to see your updates

### Editing in Notion

**When to use**: Quick updates, collaborative editing, adding comments

1. **Open the page in Notion**
2. **Make your changes** using Notion's editor
3. **Changes save automatically** and sync to files
4. **Your files update** within a few minutes

## Content Organization Best Practices

### File Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names that make sense to both humans and AI:

**Good Examples**:
- `claude-code-setup-guide.md`
- `notion-integration-troubleshooting.md`
- `team-onboarding-process.md`

**Avoid**:
- `doc1.md`
- `temp-file.md`
- `untitled.md`

### Folder Structure

Organize your content logically:

```
knowledge/
├── tools/
│   ├── ai-development/
│   ├── design-tools/
│   └── productivity/
├── frameworks/
│   ├── development/
│   ├── testing/
│   └── deployment/
└── research/
    ├── completed/
    ├── in-progress/
    └── archived/
```

### Metadata Consistency

Always include complete metadata in your files:
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Category**: Consistent with your database structure
- **Priority**: Helps with organization and AI agent decisions
- **Status**: Track progress and completion
- **Tags**: Add relevant keywords for easy searching

## Common Content Operations

### Moving Content Between Categories

**In Files**:
1. Change the `category` in the file's metadata
2. Optionally move the file to the appropriate folder
3. Save the file

**In Notion**:
1. Open the page
2. Change the Category property in the sidebar
3. Changes sync automatically

### Archiving Old Content

**Method 1: Archive Status**
1. Change the status to "Archived" 
2. Content remains accessible but appears as archived

**Method 2: Move to Archive Folder**
1. Create an `archive/` folder in your file system
2. Move old files there
3. They'll appear in a separate Notion view

### Bulk Updates

**For Multiple Files**:
1. Use your text editor's find-and-replace feature
2. Update multiple files at once
3. Changes sync automatically to Notion

**For Notion Properties**:
1. Select multiple pages in Notion
2. Use bulk edit to update properties
3. Changes sync back to files

## Backup and Recovery

### Automatic Backups

Your system automatically creates backups:
- **File versions** are maintained in your version control system
- **Notion versions** are available through Notion's version history
- **Daily snapshots** are created automatically

### Manual Backup Procedures

**Weekly File Backup** (Recommended):
1. Copy your entire knowledge folder
2. Save it to a backup location
3. Name it with the date (e.g., `knowledge-backup-2025-07-21`)

**Notion Export** (Monthly):
1. Go to Settings & Members in Notion
2. Select "Export content"
3. Choose "Export all workspace content"
4. Download and save the export file

### Recovery Procedures

**If Files Are Lost**:
1. Check your version control system for recent versions
2. Use Notion export to recreate missing files
3. Contact support if you need help with bulk recovery

**If Notion Content Is Missing**:
1. Your files are the authoritative source
2. The system will recreate Notion content from files
3. Force a sync if needed by updating file modification dates

## Content Quality Guidelines

### Writing Clear Content

**For Human Readers**:
- Use clear, simple language
- Include examples and step-by-step instructions
- Add headers and bullet points for easy scanning
- Explain technical terms when first used

**For AI Agents**:
- Include structured metadata
- Use consistent formatting
- Add specific details and measurements
- Include cross-references to related content

### Content Validation

Your system automatically checks:
- **Metadata completeness**: Required fields are present
- **Link validity**: Cross-references work correctly
- **Format consistency**: Follows established patterns
- **Content quality**: Meets readability standards

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with content management:

1. **Check the FAQ** in the reference section
2. **Review troubleshooting guides** for common solutions
3. **Ask your team** if you're working in a collaborative environment
4. **Contact support** for technical issues

Remember: Your content is always safe because the file system maintains the authoritative copy. Even if something goes wrong with Notion sync, your content is preserved in files and can be restored.
