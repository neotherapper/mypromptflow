```

**Current Sprint View** - Implementation priority
```
📊 Filtered view for active work
Filter: Implementation Priority = "Phase 1"
Sorted by: Setup Complexity, Quality Score
Grouped by: Team member assignment
```

**Quality Dashboard View** - Assessment and improvement
```
📊 Analysis view for tool evaluation

```

### Using Database Features

**Quick Property Updates:**
1. Select multiple tools using checkboxes
2. Use property bulk edit (appears in toolbar)
3. Update common properties across selections
4. Changes sync to files within 30 seconds

**Template Usage:**
```markdown
Tool Documentation Template:
- Automatically fills required YAML fields
- Provides consistent structure
- Includes placeholder sections
- Links to setup guides and examples
```

**Formula Properties:**
```javascript
// Implementation Readiness Score
if(prop("Quality Score") > 85 and prop("Setup Complexity") != "High", "✅ Ready", "⚠️ Needs Work")

// Team Consensus Indicator  
if(prop("Team Rating") - prop("Quality Score") < 10, "🤝 Aligned", "❓ Review Needed")
```

## Synchronization Process

### How Synchronization Works

**File to Notion Flow:**
```
1. You edit tool file (e.g., qdrant.md)
2. File watcher detects change (2-3 seconds)
3. System parses YAML frontmatter and content
4. Updates corresponding Notion database entry
5. Preserves Notion-specific formatting and properties
6. Updates sync timestamp and status
```

**Notion to File Flow:**
```
1. You update tool properties in Notion
2. Webhook/polling detects change (5-15 seconds)
3. System exports Notion content to markdown
4. Updates YAML frontmatter in source file
5. Preserves file structure and git history
6. Validates syntax and cross-references
```

### Sync Status Indicators

**Visual Status Indicators in Notion:**
- 🟢 **Synced** - Content is identical in both systems
- 🟡 **Syncing** - Update in progress, wait 30 seconds
- 🔴 **Conflict** - Simultaneous edits need resolution
- ⚪ **Pending** - Change detected, sync queued
- 🔵 **Manual** - Requires human intervention

**Sync Dashboard Properties:**
```
Last Sync: 2024-01-20 10:15:30
Sync Duration: 2.3 seconds
Conflicts Today: 0
Files Processed: 47
Success Rate: 99.8%
```

### Sync Timing Expectations

**Normal Operations:**
- **File → Notion**: 10-15 seconds
- **Notion → File**: 15-30 seconds  
- **Batch Operations**: 1-2 minutes
- **Full System Sync**: 5-10 minutes

**Performance Factors:**
- File size (larger files take longer)
- Network connectivity
- Notion API rate limits
- System load and concurrent users

## Limitations and Workarounds

### Notion API Limitations

**Rate Limits:**
- **Limit**: 3 requests per second per integration
- **Impact**: Slower sync for batch operations
- **Workaround**: System queues requests automatically

**Content Size Limits:**
- **Limit**: 2000 characters per rich text property
- **Impact**: Large documentation may be truncated
- **Workaround**: Use linked pages for detailed content

**Property Type Restrictions:**
- **File uploads**: Must be under 5MB
- **Formulas**: Cannot reference other databases directly
- **Relations**: Limited to 25 connections per property

### Synchronization Constraints

**Formatting Limitations:**
```markdown
✅ Supported in both systems:
- Basic markdown formatting
- Code blocks and syntax highlighting
- Links and cross-references
- Tables and lists

❌ Notion-only features (don't sync to files):
- Colored text and backgrounds
- Complex database views
- Advanced block types
- Page covers and icons
```

**Conflict Resolution:**
- System defaults to file-first strategy
- Manual resolution needed for complex conflicts
- Some formatting may be lost during resolution
- Comments and discussion don't sync to files

### Workaround Strategies

**For Large Documentation:**
1. Keep essential info in synced properties
2. Use Notion pages for extended documentation
3. Link to external documentation sources
4. Break complex tools into multiple entries

**For Rich Formatting:**
1. Use Notion for visual presentation
2. Keep files simple and clean
3. Use links between systems for rich content
4. Maintain separate presentation and source versions

**For Team Collaboration:**
1. Use Notion comments for discussions
2. Sync decisions back to files as documentation
3. Use file system for version control
4. Notion for real-time collaboration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Sync Issues

**Problem: Changes not appearing in Notion**
```
Symptoms: File edits don't update Notion database
Check: File watcher status, MCP server logs
Solution: 
1. Verify file format and YAML syntax
2. Restart file watcher service
3. Check network connectivity
4. Manual sync via admin command
```

**Problem: Notion changes not syncing to files**
```
Symptoms: Database updates don't appear in files
Check: Webhook configuration, API permissions
Solution:
1. Verify Notion integration permissions
2. Check API key validity  
3. Review webhook endpoint status
4. Test with simple property update
```

**Problem: Frequent conflicts**
```
Symptoms: Multiple conflict notifications daily
Cause: Team editing same tools simultaneously
Solution:
1. Establish editing schedules
2. Use Notion comments for coordination
3. Batch related changes together
4. Communicate major updates to team
```

### Performance Issues

**Slow Sync Times:**
```
Normal: 10-30 seconds
Slow: 1-2 minutes
Critical: >5 minutes

Troubleshooting:
1. Check file sizes (>50KB may cause delays)
2. Monitor network latency
3. Review system resource usage
4. Test with simplified content
```

**Notion Interface Slowdown:**
```
Causes:
- Large database with many properties
- Complex formulas and relations
- High-resolution images and files
- Many active users simultaneously

Solutions:
- Use filtered views instead of "All Tools"
- Limit visible properties in views
- Optimize or remove complex formulas
- Archive unused or outdated tools
```

### Data Integrity Issues

**Missing Content:**
1. Check both systems for partial content
2. Review recent backup status
3. Look for conflict archives
4. Verify cross-reference integrity
5. Restore from backup if necessary

**Inconsistent Properties:**
1. Compare YAML frontmatter with Notion properties
2. Check for unsupported characters or formats
3. Validate against schema definitions
4. Use validation tools to identify discrepancies
5. Manual reconciliation may be needed

### Getting Help

**Self-Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Check sync status dashboard
2. Review error notifications
3. Test with simple changes
4. Verify system health indicators
5. Consult troubleshooting FAQ

**Escalation Process:**
1. **Level 1** - Restart sync services
2. **Level 2** - Check with team members
3. **Level 3** - Review system logs
4. **Level 4** - Contact system administrator
5. **Level 5** - Technical support ticket
