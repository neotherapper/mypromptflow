```

### Step 2: Create Your Notion Integration (15 minutes)

**Set Up AI Access**
1. **Visit Notion Integrations:** Go to https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations
2. **Create New Integration:**
   - Name: "Claude MCP Team Assistant"
   - Workspace: Select your team workspace
   - Capabilities: Start with "Read content" only (we'll expand later)
3. **Save Your Token:** Copy the integration token and store it securely
4. **Connect to Pages:** Share relevant databases with your new integration

**Security Note:** Start with read-only access to build confidence, then gradually expand permissions as you see the system working reliably.

### Step 3: Install Claude Desktop (20 minutes)

**Download and Install**
1. **Visit:** https://claude.ai/download
2. **Download:** Select your operating system (Mac or Windows)
3. **Install:** Follow standard installation procedures
4. **Sign In:** Use your existing Claude account or create one

**Initial Configuration**
- **Open Claude Desktop:** Launch the application
- **Verify Installation:** Ensure it loads properly and you can have basic conversations
- **Note the Configuration Location:** You'll need this for the next step

### Step 4: Connect Claude to Notion (45 minutes)

**Install the MCP Server**
The simplest method for most teams:

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Verify Node.js:** Type `node --version` (should show version 16.0 or higher)
3. **If Node.js is missing:** Download from nodejs.org and install

**Configure the Connection**
Create or edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**For Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**For Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-notion"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_API_KEY": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace "your_token_here" with the actual token from Step 2.

### Step 5: Test the Connection (15 minutes)

**Verify Everything Works**
1. **Restart Claude Desktop:** Close and reopen the application
2. **Look for the Tools Icon:** You should see a small hammer/tools icon
3. **Test Basic Access:** Ask Claude "Can you see my Notion workspace?"
4. **Try a Simple Query:** "What databases do I have in my Notion workspace?"

**Troubleshooting Common Issues**
