## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### API Connection Failures
```bash
# Issue: API token authentication fails
# Solution: Verify token is correct and has proper permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_TEST_TOKEN" \
     -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
     https://api.notion.com/v1/users/me
```

#### Workspace Access Issues
```bash
# Issue: Cannot access test workspace
# Solution: Verify workspace ID and permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_TEST_TOKEN" \
     -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
     https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/$NOTION_TEST_WORKSPACE_ID
```

#### Test Item Creation Failures
- **Cause**: Database schema mismatch or missing properties
- **Solution**: Verify test workspace has required properties (Name, Category, Status, Test-ID)
- **Recovery**: Run emergency cleanup and verify workspace configuration

#### Rollback Failures
- **Cause**: API rate limiting or permission issues
- **Solution**: Wait for rate limits to reset, verify token permissions
- **Recovery**: Manual cleanup via Notion interface if automated cleanup fails
