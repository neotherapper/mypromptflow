- [✓] **Define project purpose** [Documentation] - Complete project-purpose.md with detailed goals and scope
- [ ] **Create workflows analysis** [Planning] - Document all possible workflows in docs/workflows-analysis.md
- [ ] **Document requirements specification** [Planning] - Create docs/requirements-specification.md with functional and non-functional requirements
- [ ] **Design system architecture** [Planning] - Create docs/system-architecture-v1.md with git worktree design
- [ ] **Validate architecture** [Validation] - Create docs/architecture-validation.md with validation criteria and risk assessment

## Medium Priority Tasks

- [ ] **Create implementation roadmap** [Planning] - Develop docs/implementation-roadmap.md with phased approach
- [ ] **Complete remaining template files** [Documentation] - Finish progress.md, research-integration.md, README.md
- [ ] **Research git worktree best practices** [Research] - Analyze implementation patterns and potential issues
- [ ] **Define AI agent coordination patterns** [Planning] - Design simplified coordination vs mypromptflow's 4-tier hierarchy

## Low Priority Tasks

- [ ] **Set up development environment** [Implementation] - Prepare tools and configurations for ELIA development
- [ ] **Create project templates** [Implementation] - Design templates for each worktree capability
- [ ] **Design testing framework** [Planning] - Plan validation methods for complexity reduction goals
- [ ] **Document migration strategy** [Documentation] - Detail selective migration from mypromptflow patterns

## Research Tasks

- [ ] **Analyze mypromptflow complexity sources** [Research] - Identify specific complexity drivers to avoid
- [ ] **Study git worktree integration patterns** [Research] - Research cross-worktree communication best practices
- [ ] **Evaluate AI context optimization** [Research] - Research context loading strategies for AI agents
- [ ] **Review successful framework simplification examples** [Research] - Study other successful complexity reduction cases

## Completed Tasks

- [✓] **Project structure creation** [Planning] - Created mypromptflow/projects/elia-ai-development-framework/ directory
- [✓] **CLAUDE.md customization** [Documentation] - Created AI agent instructions with project context
- [✓] **Project purpose documentation** [Documentation] - Completed comprehensive project-purpose.md
- [✓] **Initial analysis of mypromptflow complexity** [Research] - Assessed current system complexity issues

## Task Status Key

- [ ] **Not Started** - Task identified but not yet begun
- [→] **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- [✓] **Completed** - Task finished successfully
- [!] **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to dependency or issue
- [?] **Needs Clarification** - Requires more information or decision

## Task Categories

- **Research**: Gather information, analyze existing knowledge
- **Planning**: Define scope, create roadmaps, analyze requirements  
- **Implementation**: Execute main project work
- **Validation**: Review progress, test outcomes, validate against goals
- **Documentation**: Create or update project documentation

## Notes for AI Agents

- Always check the highest priority uncompleted task first
- Update task status when you begin or complete work
- Add new tasks as you discover them during work
- Move completed tasks to the "Completed Tasks" section
- If blocked, note the reason and what's needed to unblock
- Focus on completing documentation phase before moving to implementation
- Validate each architectural decision against complexity reduction goals

## Current Focus

**Phase 1: Foundation & Documentation (Current)**
- Complete all planning and documentation tasks
- Establish clear architectural vision
- Validate approach before implementation

**Next Phase Preview: Core Architecture Design**
- Design git worktree structure
- Define capability interfaces
- Create AI agent coordination patterns
