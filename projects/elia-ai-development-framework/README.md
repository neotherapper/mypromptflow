# ELIA AI Development Framework

## Overview

ELIA (Enlightened Learning and Intelligence Architecture) is a streamlined AI development framework designed to address complexity challenges in AI development workflows. Using git worktree architecture, ELIA provides clean separation of concerns across four core capabilities while maintaining effective AI agent coordination.

The framework emerged from analysis of complex AI development systems and focuses on achieving 70% complexity reduction while enabling 3x faster development iteration cycles.

## Goals

**Primary Objectives**:
- **Complexity Reduction**: 70% reduction in cognitive load compared to complex AI frameworks
- **Development Velocity**: 3x faster iteration on AI development features
- **Capability Isolation**: Clean separation enabling parallel development across AI capabilities
- **AI Agent Effectiveness**: Streamlined coordination without complexity overhead

**Core Capabilities**:
1. **Research Automation** - Automated information gathering about AI developments
2. **Knowledge Storage** - AI-accessible knowledge base for development decisions  
3. **System Evolution** - Using knowledge to create and modify development projects
4. **Learning Management** - Structured training materials and skill development

## Current Status

**Progress**: 25% - Foundation & Documentation Phase

**Priority**: High

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27

## Key Information

**Approach**: Systematic documentation-first development using git worktree architecture with selective migration of proven patterns from existing AI frameworks

**Success Criteria**: 
- Developers understand system architecture in <2 hours
- Feature development cycles 3x faster than baseline
- Context switching overhead reduced by 70%
- AI agent suggestion relevance >85%

**Constraints**: 
- 6-week initial development timeline
- Must maintain AI agent effectiveness
- Focus on AI development workflow (not general business processes)
- Single developer with AI assistance

## Getting Started

For AI agents: Start by reading [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for complete context.

For humans: Review [project-purpose.md](./project-purpose.md) for detailed information.

**Current Phase**: Foundation & Documentation - Focus on completing planning documents before implementation begins.
