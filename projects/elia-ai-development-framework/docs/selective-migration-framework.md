## Knowledge Transformation Guidelines

### Context Adaptation Patterns

**From mypromptflow Complex Context → ELIA Focused Context**:
- Extract core functionality and essential patterns
- Remove multi-layer orchestration and complex hierarchies
- Adapt context for single-capability focus
- Optimize for AI agent understanding and effectiveness

**Transformation Rules**:
1. **Simplify Instructions**: Convert complex multi-step processes to clear, direct instructions
2. **Eliminate Orchestration**: Remove complex coordination layers, use simple integration patterns
3. **Focus Context**: Adapt contexts for single capability rather than system-wide coordination
4. **Preserve Quality**: Maintain quality standards while simplifying enforcement mechanisms

### Documentation Migration Patterns

**Standard Transformation Process**:
```bash
# 1. Extract core content from mypromptflow document
# 2. Adapt context for ELIA capability focus
# 3. Simplify complex procedures and orchestration
# 4. Optimize for AI agent consumption
# 5. Validate against ELIA architectural principles
```

**Example Transformation**:
```markdown
# BEFORE (mypromptflow): Complex orchestration
## Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol
1. Initialize Queen Agent with system overview
2. Deploy Architect Agents for capability design
3. Coordinate Specialist Agents for implementation
4. Monitor Worker Agents for task execution

# AFTER (ELIA): Simplified coordination
## Capability Coordination Pattern
1. Load capability-specific context
2. Execute focused capability tasks
3. Coordinate through integration capability when needed
4. Validate results against capability success criteria
```

### Code Pattern Migration

**Pattern Simplification Guidelines**:
- Remove unnecessary abstraction layers
- Eliminate complex inheritance hierarchies
- Replace orchestration with direct function calls
- Maintain functionality while reducing complexity

**Migration Quality Criteria**:
- Functionality preserved or improved
- Complexity measurably reduced
- AI agent compatibility maintained
- Integration patterns simplified
