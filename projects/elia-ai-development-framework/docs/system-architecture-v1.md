├── shared/                       # Cross-worktree shared resources
│   ├── contexts/                 # Reusable AI context templates
│   ├── configs/                  # Shared configuration files
│   └── scripts/                  # Worktree management automation
├── CLAUDE.md                     # Universal AI context
├── README.md                     # Project overview
└── worktree/                     # All worktrees contained internally
    ├── research/                 # Research worktree (branch: research-main)

    └── integration/              # Integration worktree (branch: integration-main)
```

### Worktree Management

**Setup Commands**:
```bash
# Initial repository setup
git init elia && cd elia
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"

# Create specialized branches
git branch research-main
git branch knowledge-main
git branch learning-main
git branch tools-main
git branch integration-main

# Create worktrees
git worktree add worktree/research research-main
git worktree add worktree/knowledge knowledge-main
git worktree add worktree/learning learning-main
git worktree add worktree/tools tools-main
git worktree add worktree/integration integration-main
```

**Benefits of Internal Worktree Structure**:
