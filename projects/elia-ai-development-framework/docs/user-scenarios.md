üîê Generating Complete Authentication System for Task Management Platform

Based on your project context, here's the complete authentication implementation:

## 1. Database Schema Integration (Using Your Existing Schema)

```typescript
// This matches your existing Prisma schema
model User {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  email         String   @unique
  password_hash String
  name          String
  email_verified Boolean @default(false)
  verification_token String?
  created_at    DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at    DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Team relationships from your schema
  team_memberships TeamMember[]
}

model Team {
  id    String @id @default(cuid())
  name  String
  slug  String @unique
  
  members TeamMember[]
  invitations TeamInvitation[]
}

model TeamInvitation {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  email      String
  team_id    String
  token      String   @unique
  expires_at DateTime
  created_at DateTime @default(now())
  
  team Team @relation(fields: [team_id], references: [id])
}
```

## 2. NextAuth Configuration (Optimized for Your Use Case)

```typescript
// /lib/auth.ts
import { NextAuthOptions } from "next-auth"
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials"
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs"
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: "credentials",
      credentials: {
        email: { label: "Email", type: "email" },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" }
      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        if (!credentials?.email || !credentials?.password) {
          return null
        }

        const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
          where: { email: credentials.email },
          include: {
            team_memberships: {
              include: { team: true }
            }
          }
        })

        if (!user) {
          return null
        }

        const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(
          credentials.password,
          user.password_hash
        )

        if (!isPasswordValid) {
          return null
        }

        // Return user data that matches your personas' needs
        return {
          id: user.id,
          email: user.email,
          name: user.name,
          emailVerified: user.email_verified,
          teams: user.team_memberships.map(tm => ({
            id: tm.team.id,
            name: tm.team.name,
            role: tm.role
          }))
        }
      }
    })
  ],
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, user }) {
      if (user) {
        token.emailVerified = user.emailVerified
        token.teams = user.teams
      }
      return token
    },
    async session({ session, token }) {
      if (session.user) {
        session.user.id = token.sub as string
        session.user.emailVerified = token.emailVerified as boolean
        session.user.teams = token.teams as any[]
      }
      return session
    }
  },
  pages: {
    signIn: '/auth/login',
    signUp: '/auth/register',
  }
}
```

## 3. Registration API (Matches Your User Stories)

```typescript
// /app/api/auth/register/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs'
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'
import { sendVerificationEmail } from '@/lib/email'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { email, password, name } = await request.json()

    // Validation matching your acceptance criteria
    if (!email || !password || !name) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Missing required fields' },
        { status: 400 }
      )
    }

    // Check if user exists (supports your "unique email" requirement)
    const existingUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: { email }
    })

    if (existingUser) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'User already exists' },
        { status: 400 }
      )
    }

    // Hash password
    const password_hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12)
    
    // Generate verification token
    const verification_token = crypto.randomUUID()

    // Create user
    const user = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        email,
        password_hash,
        name,
        verification_token
      }
    })

    // Send verification email (matches your email verification story)
    await sendVerificationEmail(email, verification_token)

    return NextResponse.json({
      message: 'User created successfully. Please check your email for verification.',
      user: {
        id: user.id,
        email: user.email,
        name: user.name
      }
    })

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Registration error:', error)
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Internal server error' },
      { status: 500 }
    )
  }
}
```

## 4. Login Page (Optimized for Sarah & Mike personas)

}
```

## 5. Team Invitation System (Matches Sarah's "invite team members" story)

```typescript
// /app/api/teams/invite/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth'
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'
import { sendInvitationEmail } from '@/lib/email'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
  
  if (!session) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
  }

  try {
    const { email, team_id } = await request.json()

    // Verify user can invite to this team (Sarah's permission model)
    const teamMember = await prisma.teamMember.findFirst({
      where: {
        user_id: session.user.id,
        team_id,
        role: { in: ['OWNER', 'ADMIN'] } // Only owners/admins can invite
      }
    })

    if (!teamMember) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' }, { status: 403 })
    }

    // Check if user already exists or is already invited
    const existingUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email } })
    const existingInvitation = await prisma.teamInvitation.findFirst({
