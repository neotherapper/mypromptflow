## Project Summary

ELIA (Enlightened Learning and Intelligence Architecture) is an **AI-assisted development framework** designed to optimize the delivery of correct context to AI agents at the right time for web application development. The framework prioritizes context intelligence as the foundational capability, based on comprehensive research validating context delivery as the critical success factor for AI development effectiveness.

**Primary Goal**: Enable AI agents to receive optimal context at the right time for maximum development assistance effectiveness

**Core Capabilities**: 
1. **Context Intelligence Architecture** (Primary) - Dynamic context engine, progressive loading, real-time adaptation
2. **Research Automation** - Context-aware research with relevance filtering
3. **Knowledge Storage** - Context-optimized storage and intelligent retrieval  
4. **Learning Management** - Context recommendation improvement through usage patterns

**Research-Validated Success Criteria**: 
- **Context Delivery Performance**: 60-80% improvement through progressive loading and relevance scoring
- **Context Accuracy**: 85-95% relevance accuracy with automated pruning preventing cognitive overload
- **Context Consistency**: >98% consistency across all project documentation through cross-reference validation
- **Context Adaptation**: Real-time adjustment to changing project requirements and development phases

**Context-First Approach**: Systematic development prioritizing context intelligence with git worktree architecture optimized for context isolation and parallel development

**Strategic Constraints**: 
- Context intelligence as primary architectural principle
- Research-validated performance targets (60-80% improvement)
- Git worktree optimization for context management
- Timeline: 6-week development cycle focused on context optimization features first
