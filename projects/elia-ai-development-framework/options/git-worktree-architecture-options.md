# Git Worktree Architecture Decision Options for ELIA

## Decision Required: How should ELIA organize its codebase and capabilities for optimal AI agent coordination and complexity reduction?

Based on mypromptflow analysis and architectural research, here are the evaluated options:

## Option 1: Internal Git Worktree Structure (RECOMMENDED)

**Philosophy**: Use git worktree internal structure for capability isolation while maintaining project cohesion

**Benefits**:

- Proven 60-80% performance improvement in AI context loading (from mypromptflow analysis)
- Clean separation of concerns with physical isolation
- Parallel development support for multiple AI agents
- Everything contained within main project directory
- Tool compatibility with standard development environments

**Drawbacks**:

- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with git worktrees
- Slightly more complex path management

  **Complexity Impact**: Significantly reduces complexity through capability isolation

  **AI Agent Effectiveness**: Optimizes context loading and enables parallel work

  **Implementation**:

```bash
elia/
├── worktree/research/     # Research capability
├── worktree/knowledge/    # Knowledge management
├── worktree/learning/     # Training materials
├── worktree/tools/        # Code generation
├── worktree/integration/  # Cross-capability coordination
└── shared/               # Common resources
```

## Option 2: Monorepo Structure

**Philosophy**: Single repository with directory-based separation

**Benefits**:

- Familiar structure for most developers
- Simpler git operations
- Easier setup and initialization

  **Drawbacks**:

- No physical isolation between capabilities
- Context loading includes irrelevant information
- More complex dependency management
- Harder to coordinate parallel AI agent work

  **Complexity Impact**: Maintains higher complexity due to lack of isolation

  **AI Agent Effectiveness**: Lower due to context pollution and coordination challenges

  **Implementation**: Traditional directory structure with shared git history

## Option 3: Separate Repositories

**Philosophy**: Each capability as independent repository

**Benefits**:

- Complete isolation between capabilities
- Independent versioning and deployment
- Clear ownership boundaries

  **Drawbacks**:

- Complex coordination between repositories
- Difficult cross-capability integration
- Higher maintenance overhead
- Breaks project cohesion

  **Complexity Impact**: High coordination complexity

  **AI Agent Effectiveness**: Difficult cross-capability workflows

  **Implementation**: Multiple repositories with complex integration

## Option 4: Microservices Architecture

**Philosophy**: Each capability as independent service

**Benefits**:

- Scalable and distributed
- Technology diversity possible
- Complete isolation

  **Drawbacks**:

- Massive complexity increase
- Network coordination overhead
- Deployment complexity
- Goes against ELIA simplicity goals

  **Complexity Impact**: Significantly increases complexity

  **AI Agent Effectiveness**: High coordination overhead

  **Implementation**: Service mesh with API coordination

## Recommendation Summary

**Primary Recommendation**: Internal Git Worktree Structure (Option 1)
**Alternative Option**: Monorepo Structure (Option 2) if worktree learning curve is too high

**Decision Factors**:

- Proven performance benefits from mypromptflow analysis
- Aligns with ELIA's complexity reduction goals
- Enables parallel AI agent coordination
- Maintains project cohesion
  **ELIA Goal Alignment**:
- Supports 70% complexity reduction through capability isolation
- Enables 3x development velocity through optimized context loading
- Facilitates parallel AI agent operations
- Reduces cognitive load through clean separation
