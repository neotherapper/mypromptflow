# ELIA Decision Options Management Guide

## Purpose of This Folder

The `/options/` folder contains **research-based option analyses** and recommendations for ELIA architectural decisions that require user input. These are comprehensive evaluations that help inform decision-making while maintaining ELIA's core goals.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Folder Structure

- **`/options/`** - Research-based analyses and recommendations (this folder)
- **`/decisions/`** - ONLY finalized decisions with user agreement

**Workflow**: Research → Options Analysis → User Decision → Move to `/decisions/`

## Option Document Standards

### Required Format for All Option Files

```markdown

**Complexity Impact**: [Effect on 70% complexity reduction goal]
**AI Agent Effectiveness**: [Impact on AI coordination and parallel work]
**Implementation**: [Requirements and approach]

## Option 2: [Name]
[Same structure]

## Recommendation Summary
**Primary Recommendation**: [Specific choice with reasoning]
**Alternative Option**: [Backup choice]
**Decision Factors**: [Key considerations for ELIA success]
**ELIA Goal Alignment**: [How choice supports complexity reduction and AI effectiveness]
```

- `requirements-refinement-options.md` - Updated requirements based on user preferences

## Option to Decision Process

### 1. Complete Research
- Gather information on Claude Code specialized agents
- Analyze mypromptflow patterns for proven approaches
- Quantify complexity impacts and AI effectiveness
- Identify implementation requirements for ELIA

### 2. Create Option Analysis
- Document all viable alternatives for ELIA
- Provide clear recommendations aligned with complexity reduction
- Include implementation guidance for git worktree architecture
- Show decision trade-offs for AI agent coordination

### 3. Present to User
- Clear presentation of options with ELIA goal alignment
- Highlight recommended choice for complexity reduction
- Explain reasoning and implications for parallel AI work
- Request explicit decision with understanding of trade-offs

### 4. Document Decision
- Move agreed option to `/decisions/`
- Document user confirmation and reasoning
- Update ELIA project dependencies
- Enable next phase architectural work

## Working with Option Documents

### For AI Agents
- Create comprehensive option analyses focused on ELIA goals
- Base recommendations on mypromptflow research and complexity analysis
- Present clear trade-offs for AI agent effectiveness
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with architecture

### For Users
- Review option analyses with ELIA complexity reduction goals in mind
- Consider trade-offs for parallel AI development and maritime insurance SDLC
- Make explicit choices based on project structure preferences
- Confirm decisions for documentation in `/decisions/`

## File Management

### Option Document Lifecycle
1. **Research Phase**: Gather information on Claude Code, AI coordination patterns
2. **Option Creation**: Document findings in comprehensive option analysis
3. **User Review**: Present options for ELIA architectural decision-making
4. **Decision**: User selects preferred option aligned with ELIA goals
5. **Documentation**: Move to `/decisions/` with user confirmation
6. **Archive**: Option document remains for historical reference

### Naming Conventions
- `[topic]-options.md` - Option analyses for ELIA decisions
- Include research date and ELIA goal alignment
- Link to relevant mypromptflow patterns and research findings
- Reference related option documents and dependencies

## ELIA-Specific Option Analysis Criteria

### Every Option Must Address
- **Complexity Impact**: How does this choice affect the 70% complexity reduction goal?
- **AI Agent Effectiveness**: Will this maintain >85% AI agent success rate?
- **Parallel Development**: Does this enable multiple AI agents working simultaneously?
- **Development Velocity**: How does this support 3x faster iteration cycles?
- **Research Integration**: How will this stay current with Claude Code updates?
- **Maritime Insurance SDLC**: Does this support full AI-driven development lifecycle?

### Decision Quality Gates
- [ ] Option aligns with ELIA core goals
- [ ] Complexity impact clearly analyzed
- [ ] AI agent coordination implications understood
- [ ] Implementation path compatible with git worktree architecture
- [ ] User preferences (AI instructions over code) considered
- [ ] Research pipeline integration addressed

Remember: This folder contains **decision preparation materials** that inform ELIA architectural choices. Only move content to `/decisions/` after explicit user agreement that aligns with ELIA's complexity reduction and AI effectiveness objectives.
