# Git Worktree vs Claude Sub-Agents: Strategic Analysis for ELIA

## Executive Summary

The introduction of Claude Code sub-agents fundamentally changes the strategic value of git worktree architecture for ELIA. This analysis evaluates whether git worktree remains necessary given sub-agents' context isolation capabilities, and identifies optimal integration patterns.

**Key Finding**: Git worktree and sub-agents serve **complementary purposes** - worktree for file system isolation, sub-agents for context isolation. Combined, they create an **unprecedented development architecture**.
