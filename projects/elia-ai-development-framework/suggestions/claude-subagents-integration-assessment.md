```
Traditional ELIA Context Challenge:
Main Context: React architecture + debugging details + API design + testing
↓
Context Overload: Reduced effectiveness, cognitive burden

Sub-Agents ELIA Architecture:
Main Context: High-level architecture decisions
├── Frontend Agent: React/UI work (isolated 200k context)
├── Backend Agent: API development (isolated 200k context)
├── Testing Agent: Quality assurance (isolated 200k context)
└── Integration Agent: Cross-domain coordination (isolated 200k context)
```
