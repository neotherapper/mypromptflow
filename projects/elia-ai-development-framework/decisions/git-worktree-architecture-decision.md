# Git Worktree Architecture Decision for ELIA

## Decision Approved: Internal Git Worktree Structure

**Decision Date**: 2025-01-27
**User Confirmation**: Agreed to Option 1 with assessment of worktree count during implementation

## Selected Approach

**Philosophy**: Use git worktree internal structure for capability isolation while maintaining project cohesion.

**Architecture**:
```bash
elia/
├── worktree/research/     # Research capability
├── worktree/knowledge/    # Knowledge management
├── worktree/learning/     # Training materials
├── worktree/tools/        # Code generation
├── worktree/integration/  # Cross-capability coordination
└── shared/               # Common resources
```

## Key Benefits

- **Clean Separation**: Physical isolation between capabilities
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple AI agents can work on different capabilities simultaneously
- **Project Cohesion**: Everything contained within main project directory
- **Tool Compatibility**: Works with standard development environments
- **Performance Optimization**: Enables optimized context loading per capability

## Implementation Considerations

### Worktree Count Assessment
- **Implementation Phase Determination**: Exact number of worktrees to be assessed during implementation
- **Capability-Based Structure**: One worktree per major ELIA capability
- **Flexibility**: Additional worktrees can be created as needed for specialization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track context loading improvements per worktree

### Directory Structure Guidelines
- **Capability Isolation**: Each worktree contains complete capability implementation
- **Shared Resources**: Common configurations and utilities in shared directory
- **Integration Points**: Clear interfaces between worktrees for coordination
- **Documentation**: Each worktree contains its own README and capability documentation

## Complexity Impact

- **Significant Reduction**: Capability isolation reduces cognitive load
- **Context Optimization**: AI agents load only relevant capability context
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Multiple agents work without context interference
- **Maintenance Simplification**: Changes isolated to specific capabilities

## AI Agent Effectiveness

- **Optimized Context Loading**: Agents access only relevant capability information
- **Parallel Operations**: Multiple agents work on different capabilities simultaneously
- **Reduced Confusion**: Clear capability boundaries prevent cross-contamination
- **Faster Iteration**: Changes don't require understanding entire system

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Git Worktree Setup**: Initialize worktree structure for each capability
2. **Shared Resource Management**: Define common resources and access patterns
3. **Integration Protocols**: Establish communication between worktrees
4. **Documentation Standards**: Capability-specific documentation in each worktree
5. **AI Agent Training**: Update agents to work with worktree-based structure

## Success Criteria

- **Context Loading Performance**: Measurable improvement in AI context processing
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple AI agents working effectively on different capabilities
- **Capability Isolation**: Clean separation without unwanted dependencies
- **Development Velocity**: Faster iteration through focused capability work

## Future Considerations

- **Scalability**: Additional worktrees can be added for new capabilities
- **Integration Patterns**: Standard protocols for cross-worktree communication
- **Tool Integration**: Development tools adapted to worktree structure
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of worktree effectiveness

This decision establishes the foundation for ELIA's capability isolation strategy, enabling effective parallel AI development while maintaining project coherence and reducing complexity.
