# Capability Migration Decisions for ELIA

## Decision Approved: Selective Migration with New Capabilities

**Decision Date**: 2025-01-27
**User Confirmation**: Agreed to capabilities 1-6, 8-12, 14-15, plus assessment of simplified version for 13

## Approved Migrations

### MANDATORY MIGRATIONS (Items 1-4)
1. **Research Orchestrator Framework** - Simplified from 15+ to 4-6 core research methods
2. **Knowledge Vault Core Structure** - 4-database file-based approach 
3. **Cross-Reference Management System** - Simplified bidirectional linking
4. **Progressive Context Loading** - Direct migration with 60-80% performance improvement

### APPROVED CAPABILITIES (Items 5-6)
5. **AI Agent Hierarchy** - DO NOT MIGRATE (conflicts with complexity reduction)
6. **Constitutional AI Validation Framework** - Simplified validation for quality and accuracy

### NEW CAPABILITIES REQUIRED (Items 8-12, 14-15)
8. **Full SDLC Coordination** - AI-native SDLC with human validation at each stage
9. **Parallel AI Agent Coordination** - Multiple agents working simultaneously
10. **Git Worktree Management** - NEW capability (not migrated from mypromptflow)
11. **Claude Code Specialized Agent Integration** - Sub-agent integration capability
12. **Research Pipeline for Technology Updates** - All project technologies (Claude Code, React, FastAPI, CI/CD, performance, etc.)
14. **AI Instruction File Templates** - Comprehensive AI instruction framework
15. **Code Pattern Library** - Domain-specific patterns for different project types

### SPECIAL ASSESSMENT (Item 13)
13. **Document Registry System** - Assess simplified version focusing on documents that greatly help AI-assisted development (like PRD documents)

### CORRECTED PROJECT TEMPLATE (Item 7)
7. **Project Template System** - Support for different web application approaches under same repo vs separate repos

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Foundation) - Weeks 1-2
- Progressive Context Loading
- Git Worktree Management (new capability)
- Knowledge Vault Core Structure  
- Basic Project Template System

### Phase 2 (Core Capabilities) - Weeks 3-4
- Research Orchestrator Framework (simplified)
- AI Instruction File Templates
- Cross-Reference Management System
- Code Pattern Library (basic)

### Phase 3 (Advanced Features) - Weeks 5-6
- Claude Code Specialized Agent Integration
- Full SDLC Coordination with human validation
- Parallel AI Agent Coordination
- Research Pipeline for All Technologies

## Key Corrections Made

- **Git Worktree**: Corrected from "proven patterns" to new capability development
- **Project Templates**: Focused on different web app approaches rather than specific domains
- **Research Pipeline**: Expanded from just Claude Code/React to all project technologies
- **Document Registry**: Changed from "do not migrate" to "assess simplified version"

## Alignment with ELIA Goals

- **Complexity Reduction**: Eliminated complex hierarchies and excessive document types
- **AI Effectiveness**: Focused on capabilities that enhance AI agent operations
- **Parallel Development**: Enabled through git worktree and parallel coordination
- **Technology Currency**: Automated research pipeline for all relevant technologies

This selective migration approach ensures ELIA gets the proven benefits of mypromptflow patterns while maintaining simplicity and enabling the enhanced AI coordination capabilities required for effective parallel development.
