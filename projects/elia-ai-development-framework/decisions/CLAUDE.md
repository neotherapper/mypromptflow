# ELIA Decision Management Guide

## Purpose of This Folder

The `/decisions/` folder contains **only user-agreed choices** with complete reasoning and alternatives considered. This is the authoritative source for what has been decided vs what still needs agreement for ELIA.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Folder Structure

- **`/decisions/`** - ONLY finalized decisions with user agreement
- **`/options/`** - Decision option analyses and research-based recommendations

**Rule**: Move files from `/options/` to `/decisions/` only after user confirmation.

## Decision Status Dashboard

### ❌ Pending User Decisions
- **Project Structure**: Single web app vs multiple projects (maritime insurance + artists site)
- **AI Agent Coordination**: Specialized agents, parallel work coordination patterns
- **Technology Implementation**: AI instruction files vs traditional code approach
- **SDLC Integration**: Tool selection for full AI-driven development lifecycle
- **Research Pipeline**: Claude Code updates and knowledge base evolution strategy
- **Knowledge Management**: File-based vs database storage approach (refined)

### ✅ Confirmed Decisions
*None yet - awaiting user input*

```

### Quality Gates for Decision Documentation

- ✅ **User Confirmation**: Clear evidence of user agreement
- ✅ **Complete Reasoning**: Why this choice over alternatives
- ✅ **Implementation Path**: What this enables and requires
- ✅ **Change Control**: When and how decisions can be modified

## Decision Process Protocols

### 1. Prepare Decision Materials
**From Research**: Use current research findings and mypromptflow analysis
**Present Clearly**: Show pros/cons, complexity impacts, AI agent effectiveness
**Include Recommendations**: Provide AI analysis of best options for ELIA goals
**Show Dependencies**: Explain what this decision enables/blocks

### 2. Get User Agreement
**Present Options**: Clear format with reasoning for each alternative
**Ask Explicitly**: "Which option do you choose and why?"
**Confirm Understanding**: Ensure user sees implications for ELIA architecture
**Document Choice**: Record exact user response

### 3. Lock Decision
**Create Decision File**: Use standard format in this folder
**Update Dependencies**: Enable blocked work to proceed
**Notify System**: Update main CLAUDE.md with decision status
**Track History**: Add to agreements-log.md

### 4. Enable Next Work
**Update Project Status**: What can now be done
**Unblock Tasks**: Start decision-dependent work
**Validate Usage**: Ensure decisions are used correctly in deliverables

## Decision Categories and Dependencies

### Primary Decisions (Block Major Work)
1. **Project Structure** → Enables architecture design, agent coordination
2. **AI Agent Coordination** → Enables parallel development workflows
3. **Technology Implementation** → Enables specific implementation approach
4. **SDLC Integration** → Enables full development lifecycle support

### Secondary Decisions (Refinement)
1. **Research Pipeline** → Enhances knowledge base evolution
2. **Knowledge Management** → Optimizes storage and retrieval patterns
3. **Performance Optimization** → Improves system efficiency

## Decision Validation Rules

### Before Creating Decision Files
- ❌ **No Assumptions**: Never assume user preferences about ELIA structure
- ❌ **No Defaults**: Always present options for user choice
- ❌ **No Inferring**: Explicit agreement required for architectural decisions

### When Using Decisions
- ✅ **Follow Exactly**: Use decisions as documented
- ✅ **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required decisions exist
- ✅ **Validate Consistency**: Ensure decisions work together for ELIA goals

### Decision Modification
- **User Request Required**: Only user can change decisions
- **Impact Analysis**: Show what changes if decision modified
- **Re-validation**: Check all dependent work still valid

## Current Priority Actions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create Critical Decision Options**: Project structure, AI coordination, technology approach
2. **Research Claude Code Specialization**: Understand specialized agents and integration
3. **Prepare Decision Materials**: Create user-ready option analysis
4. **Schedule Decision Sessions**: Present options for user choice

### Waiting For
- **User Availability**: Need user input for all major architectural decisions
- **Research Completion**: Claude Code specialized agents analysis
- **Option Analysis**: Final preparation of decision materials

- `technology-implementation-decision.md` - AI instructions vs code approach
- `sdlc-integration-decision.md` - Tool selection and full lifecycle support
- `research-pipeline-decision.md` - Knowledge evolution strategy
- `knowledge-management-decision.md` - Storage and retrieval approach
- `agreements-log.md` - Complete decision history

## Quality Assurance

### Decision File Checklist
- [ ] User agreement clearly documented
- [ ] All alternatives considered and documented  
- [ ] Implementation requirements specified for ELIA
- [ ] Dependencies and enablements identified
- [ ] Change management process defined
- [ ] Impact on ELIA goals (complexity reduction, AI effectiveness) assessed

### Usage Validation
- [ ] Decisions used correctly in ELIA deliverables
- [ ] No architectural work proceeds without required decisions
- [ ] Dependencies properly tracked and respected
- [ ] Quality maintained throughout ELIA implementation

## ELIA-Specific Decision Context

### Key ELIA Goals to Consider in All Decisions
- **70% Complexity Reduction**: All decisions must support this goal
- **3x Development Velocity**: Technology choices must enable faster iteration
- **AI Agent Effectiveness**: Coordination patterns must maintain >85% success rate
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple AI agents working simultaneously
- **Research Integration**: Stay current with Claude Code and framework updates

### Architecture Constraints from Previous Planning
- Git worktree structure already validated and approved
- File-based storage preferred over complex database systems
- Local-first architecture with optional cloud integration
- Capability isolation with selective integration

Remember: This folder represents **committed architectural choices** that enable confident ELIA implementation. No guessing, no assumptions - only documented user agreements that align with ELIA's complexity reduction and AI effectiveness goals.
