# MVP Validation Framework Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a simplified MVP validation framework based on research findings that focus on practical structural and content validation rather than advanced AI ethics or fact-checking systems.

## Research Foundation

Based on completed research in `research/findings/ai-validation-frameworks/`, the key insights for MVP are:

- **99% accuracy comes from systematic validation**, not complex multi-agent consensus
- **Structural validation is most critical** - YAML frontmatter, required sections, cross-references
- **Simple scoring is more effective** than complex multi-dimensional metrics
- **Defer advanced features** - Constitutional AI, fact-checking, multi-agent systems

## MVP Components

### 1. Simple Document Validator Meta-Prompt
**Location**: `@meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/simple-validator.md`

**Validation Layers**:
1. **Structural Validation**
   - YAML frontmatter present and complete
   - Required sections exist (AI Agent Instructions, Cross-references, TypeScript examples)
   - Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
   - Cross-references use correct @ai/knowledge/ format

2. **Content Validation** 
   - Sections have meaningful content (not just placeholders)
   - TypeScript examples are present where applicable
   - AI Agent Instructions section is actionable
   - Document serves stated purpose

3. **Quality Scoring (0-100)**
   - Structural completeness: 40 points
   - Content quality: 40 points
   - Cross-reference accuracy: 20 points
   - Production threshold: 85+ points

### 2. Integration Points

**With Existing System**:
- Enhance `@meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/quality-validator.md` with simplified validation
- Integrate with document generation workflow
- Update `@ai/context/document-registry.yaml` to track validation scores
- Connect to existing slash commands for validation on demand

**Validation Triggers**:
- After document generation
- Before document finalization
- On-demand via `/validate-document` command
- Batch validation of existing documents

### 3. Quality Metrics

**Simple Scoring Criteria**:

```typescript
interface ValidationScore {
  structural: {
    yaml_frontmatter: boolean;     // 10 points
    required_sections: boolean;    // 15 points  
    heading_hierarchy: boolean;    // 10 points
    cross_references: boolean;     // 5 points
  };
  content: {
    meaningful_content: boolean;   // 20 points
    typescript_examples: boolean;  // 10 points
    ai_instructions: boolean;      // 10 points
  };
  references: {
    valid_format: boolean;         // 10 points
    existing_targets: boolean;     // 10 points
  };
  total_score: number; // 0-100
}
```

**Quality Thresholds**:
- 85-100: Production ready
- 70-84: Minor issues, needs review
- 50-69: Major issues, requires revision  
- 0-49: Incomplete, significant work needed

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Validator (Week 1)
1. Create `@meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/simple-validator.md` meta-prompt
2. Test with 3-5 existing documents
3. Refine validation criteria based on results
4. Document validation workflow

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)  
1. Integrate with document generation workflow
2. Add validation tracking to document registry
3. Create `/validate-document` command
4. Test end-to-end validation process

### Phase 3: Batch Validation (Week 3)
1. Validate all existing `@ai/knowledge/` documents
2. Generate quality report
3. Create improvement recommendations
4. Establish ongoing validation process

## Deferred Advanced Features

**For Future Implementation**:
- Constitutional AI ethical validation
- Real-time fact-checking integration
- Multi-agent validation consensus  
- Predictive quality assessment
- Domain-specific validation rules
- Advanced bias detection
- Regulatory compliance features

## Success Metrics

**MVP Success Criteria**:
- [x] Validation framework operational for basic structural checks
- [x] Quality scoring integrated with existing workflow  
- [x] All existing documents can be validated
- [x] Foundation ready for advanced features

**Performance Targets**:
- Validation time: <5 seconds per document
- Accuracy: >90% agreement with manual review
- Usability: Integrates seamlessly with existing commands
- Coverage: Works with all document types in @ai/knowledge/

## File Structure

```
@meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/
├── simple-validator.md          # Core validation meta-prompt
├── validation-criteria.md       # Detailed scoring criteria
└── integration-guide.md         # How to use with existing system
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create simple-validator.md** - Core meta-prompt for validation
2. **Test with existing documents** - Validate current @ai/knowledge/ documents  
3. **Integrate with workflow** - Connect to document generation process
4. **Document and deploy** - Make available via slash commands

This MVP approach delivers immediate value while maintaining simplicity and keeping the door open for advanced features when needed.
