## Risk Management

### Current Risks
**LOW RISK** - Project in good shape for execution

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Research Framework Dependency**: Research orchestrator tested and functional
- **Integration Complexity**: Building on proven existing architecture at `@ai/`
- **Scope Creep**: Clear phase boundaries and success criteria defined
- **Technical Complexity**: Pure meta-prompting approach minimizes code dependencies

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Begin Phase 1 Research** - Start with "Research AI validation frameworks and quality metrics"
2. **Validate Research Integration** - Ensure research orchestrator triggers correctly
3. **Design Validation System** - Based on research findings
4. **Implement Quality Scoring** - Build automated document validation
5. **Integrate with Existing System** - Connect validation with `@ai/agents/`
