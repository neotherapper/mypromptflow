# Knowledge Base Context: Defining Structure and Relationships

This document provides an in-depth look into the `ai/context/` directory, which houses the foundational configuration files for the AI Knowledge Base. These files are crucial for defining the structure, relationships, and metadata of all documents within the system, enabling intelligent dependency management, document tracking, and tiered organization.

## 1. Role of Context Files

The context files serve as the central metadata repository for the entire knowledge base. They enable the system to:

*   **Manage Document Dependencies**: Understand which documents are prerequisites for others.
*   **Track Document Status**: Keep a registry of all documents, their versions, and current states.
*   **Organize by Tiers**: Categorize documents based on their strategic importance or level of detail.
*   **Facilitate AI Orchestration**: Provide AI agents with the necessary context to generate coherent and relevant content.

## 2. Key Context Files

### 2.1. `dependencies.yaml`

This file defines the prerequisite relationships between different document types. It outlines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependencies, ensuring that foundational documents are created before more complex ones that rely on them. It also specifies the expected outputs from each document type, which can be used by downstream AI agents.

### 2.2. `document-registry.yaml`

This file acts as a central registry for all documents within the knowledge base. It tracks metadata for each document, including its ID, type, file path, version, status, creation and modification dates, and whether its dependencies are satisfied. This registry is crucial for maintaining an up-to-date inventory of the knowledge base and for enabling efficient search and retrieval.

### 2.3. `feature-registry.yaml` and `tier-configuration.yaml`

While not detailed here, these files likely serve similar purposes to `document-registry.yaml` but are specialized for tracking features and defining the characteristics of different document tiers, respectively.

## 3. Conclusion

The context files in `ai/context/` are foundational to the AI Knowledge Base project. They provide the necessary metadata and structural definitions that enable the system to intelligently manage, generate, and validate comprehensive business documentation. By clearly defining dependencies, tracking document status, and organizing content by tiers, these files ensure the coherence, consistency, and overall quality of the knowledge base.
