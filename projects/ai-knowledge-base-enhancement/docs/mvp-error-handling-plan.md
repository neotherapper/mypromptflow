# MVP Error Handling System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a simplified MVP error handling system based on research findings that focus on practical failure detection and recovery rather than complex multi-agent systems.

## Research Foundation

Based on completed research in `research/findings/ai-agent-failure-patterns/`, the key insights for MVP are:

- **Communication failures dominate** (35-40% of all failures)
- **Circuit breaker pattern achieves 85-90% success rate**
- **Simple retry mechanisms are most effective**
- **Graceful degradation provides 90-95% functionality preservation**

## MVP Components

### 1. Simple Failure Detection Meta-Prompt
**Location**: `@ai/error-handling/failure-detector.md`

**Detection Categories**:
1. **Communication Failures**
   - Agent non-response or timeout
   - Invalid response format
   - Tool execution failures
   - Network connectivity issues

2. **Content Failures**
   - Empty or incomplete responses
   - Malformed output structure
   - Missing required sections
   - Invalid cross-references

3. **Workflow Failures**
   - Agent stuck in loops
   - Dependency resolution failures
   - Task completion without output
   - Process abandonment

### 2. Basic Recovery Strategies
**Location**: `@ai/error-handling/recovery-strategies.md`

**Recovery Methods**:
1. **Simple Retry (3 attempts)**
   - Immediate retry for transient failures
   - Exponential backoff for repeated failures
   - Different prompt variations for each retry

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Partial completion acceptance
   - Simplified output format
   - Reduced scope for complex tasks

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Switch to simpler meta-prompts
   - Break complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Use different agent instruction styles

### 3. Error Logging and Learning
**Location**: `@ai/error-handling/error-log.yaml`

**Simple Error Tracking**:
```yaml
error_log:
  - timestamp: "2025-01-06T19:00:00Z"
    task: "document-generation"
    failure_type: "communication"
    recovery_method: "retry"
    success: true
    attempts: 2
```

**Learning Patterns**:
- Track failure frequencies by task type
- Identify most effective recovery methods
- Note patterns for future prevention

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Detection (Week 1)
1. Create `@ai/error-handling/failure-detector.md` meta-prompt
2. Test detection with known failure scenarios
3. Refine failure classification criteria
4. Document detection workflow

### Phase 2: Recovery System (Week 2)
1. Create `@ai/error-handling/recovery-strategies.md`
2. Implement simple retry mechanism
3. Add graceful degradation options
4. Test end-to-end recovery process

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)
1. Integrate with existing AI agent workflows
2. Add error logging to task completion
3. Create recovery success tracking
4. Establish continuous improvement process

## Deferred Advanced Features

**For Future Implementation**:
- Multi-agent consensus recovery
- Predictive failure prevention
- Advanced circuit breaker patterns
- Machine learning failure prediction
- Complex dependency failure handling
- Real-time failure monitoring dashboards

## Success Metrics

**MVP Success Criteria**:
- Automatic failure detection for common scenarios
- 85%+ recovery success rate with simple retry
- Error logging integrated with task tracking
- Foundation ready for advanced features

**Performance Targets**:
- Recovery time: <30 seconds for simple retries
- Detection accuracy: >90% for clear failure cases
- Integration: Works with existing document generation
- Coverage: Handles top 3 failure types (communication, content, workflow)

## File Structure

```

├── error-log-template.yaml     # Error tracking template
└── integration-guide.md        # How to use with existing system
```

## Integration Points

**With Existing System**:
- Enhance existing meta-prompts with failure detection
- Add recovery triggers to document generation workflow
- Integrate error logging with task completion tracking
- Connect to existing agent orchestration system

**Recovery Triggers**:
- After agent timeout (>2 minutes)
- On malformed output detection
- When required sections missing
- During workflow abandonment

## Next Steps

1. **Create failure-detector.md** - Core meta-prompt for failure detection
2. **Implement simple retry system** - Basic 3-attempt retry with backoff
3. **Add error logging** - Track failures and recovery success
4. **Test with existing workflows** - Validate recovery effectiveness

This MVP approach provides immediate failure resilience while keeping complexity minimal and deferring advanced features for future enhancement.
