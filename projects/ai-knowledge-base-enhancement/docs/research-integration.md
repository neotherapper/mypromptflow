# Research Framework Integration for AI Knowledge Base Enhancement

## Overview

This document outlines how the AI Knowledge Base Enhancement project integrates with the existing research framework at `@research/orchestrator/` to conduct comprehensive research for each enhancement phase.

## Research Framework Activation Strategy

### Automatic Research Trigger Detection

The existing research framework automatically activates when AI agents detect specific research intention keywords. For this project, all research tasks are designed to trigger the orchestrator automatically.

#### Research Trigger Keywords Used:
- **"Research"** - Primary trigger for systematic analysis
- **"Investigate"** - Triggers comprehensive investigation workflows  
- **"Analyze"** - Activates detailed examination processes
- **"Examine"** - Initiates thorough review methodologies
- **"Study"** - Triggers academic-style research approaches

### Research Task Design

Each research task follows the pattern:
```
"Research [domain] [specific topic] and [methodology focus]"
```

This ensures the research orchestrator recognizes the intent and activates appropriate research workflows.
