### Enhanced Selection Algorithm

#### New MCP-Aware Scoring Formula
```
Total Score = (Capability Match × 0.30) + 
              (Setup Simplicity × 0.20) + 
              (Performance × 0.18) + 
              (Reliability × 0.15) + 
              (Authentication Fit × 0.10) + 
              (Rate Limit Compatibility × 0.07)

MCP Server Bonus = +0.5 points for native MCP integration
Tier Bonus = Tier 1: +0.3, Tier 2: +0.2, Tier 3: +0.1
```
