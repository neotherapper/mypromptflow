# AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator

> An AI-powered information update system that intelligently gathers, processes, validates, and organizes information from diverse sources using sophisticated AI agent orchestration.

## Overview

The AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator is a comprehensive framework designed to automate information gathering and processing through intelligent AI agent coordination. The system uses multiple AI agents working together to:

- **Gather Information** from diverse sources (RSS feeds, web scraping, APIs, MCP servers)
- **Process Content** with quality assessment and validation frameworks
- **Organize Data** using markdown/YAML storage for AI agent accessibility  
- **Learn Adaptively** to optimize update frequencies based on content change patterns
- **Ensure Quality** through reproducible verification and source credibility assessment

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Comprehensive Research (Phase 1 of 3)

**Research Focus**: Systematically cataloging and evaluating ALL possible information retrieval methods, storage solutions, quality assessment frameworks, and AI agent orchestration patterns.

## Three-Phase Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Research *(Current)*
- **Information Retrieval Methods** - RSS, MCP servers, web scraping, APIs, search engines
- **Storage Solutions** - Markdown/YAML patterns, file organization, metadata schemas
- **Quality Assessment** - Source verification, content validation, bias detection
- **Orchestration Patterns** - AI agent coordination for information processing workflows

### Phase 2: System Architecture & Planning *(Future)*
- Design implementation strategy based on research findings
- Create detailed technical architecture and integration plans
- Develop testing and validation frameworks

### Phase 3: Gradual MVP Implementation *(Future)*
- Start with single source (likely RSS feeds) for proof of concept
- Validate approach and expand to additional sources based on research findings
- Iterative development with quality validation at each step

## Key Technologies & Approaches

### Information Sources
- **RSS/Atom Feeds** - Traditional and modern feed processing
- **MCP Servers** - Wikipedia, YouTube transcription, Playwright web automation
- **Web APIs** - REST, GraphQL, real-time data streams
- **Web Scraping** - Automated content extraction from websites
- **Search Engines** - Google, Bing, specialized search APIs

### AI Agent Orchestration
- **4-Level Hierarchy** - Queen → Architect → Specialist → Worker agents
- **Parallel Processing** - Concurrent information gathering and validation
- **Quality Assurance** - Multi-agent verification and consensus building
- **Error Recovery** - Robust handling of source failures and data issues

### Storage & Organization
- **Markdown Files** - Human and AI-readable content storage
- **YAML Metadata** - Structured configuration and status tracking
- **File-Based Architecture** - No database dependencies for core functionality
- **Git Integration** - Version control for information updates

### Quality & Intelligence
- **Reproducible Scoring** - Consistent quality assessment across agents
- **Source Verification** - Credibility ranking and bias detection
- **Adaptive Learning** - Dynamic scheduling based on content change patterns
- **Constitutional AI** - Ethical validation and bias prevention

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Comprehensive Information Access** - Catalog and implement ALL viable information retrieval methods
2. **Quality Assurance** - Create repeatable, deterministic quality assessment frameworks
3. **Intelligent Automation** - Develop adaptive systems that learn optimal update patterns
