# MCP Knowledge Base

## Purpose

This knowledge base systematically catalogs the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server ecosystem to inform implementation decisions for the AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator. Rather than proceeding with limited knowledge, we are building comprehensive understanding of available MCP servers before making technology choices.

## Current Status: Discovery Phase

**Phase**: Systematic MCP ecosystem research
**Goal**: Catalog 500+ servers before implementation decisions  
**Progress**: Initial setup complete, beginning repository research

## File Structure

## Discovery Strategy

### Repository Research Priority
1. **wong2/awesome-mcp-servers** (High) - Community curated quality
2. **modelcontextprotocol/servers** (High) - Official reference implementations  
3. **appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers** (Medium) - Comprehensive collection
4. **TensorBlock/awesome-mcp-servers** (Medium) - Massive 7260+ server collection
5. **docker/mcp-servers** (Medium) - Enterprise implementations
6. **punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers** (Low) - Additional coverage
7. **habitoai/awesome-mcp-servers** (Low) - AI-focused implementations

### Quality Standards
- **Evidence-Based Analysis**: All information verified from official sources
- **Information Retrieval Focus**: Prioritize servers applicable to information access
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Assess real-world deployment complexity
- **Current Data**: Emphasize 2024-2025 active projects and recent updates

## Implementation Readiness Criteria

**Do not proceed to implementation until:**
- [ ] 500+ servers cataloged from major repositories
- [ ] 100+ information retrieval relevant servers identified
- [ ] Clear capability matrix for top 20-30 candidates
- [ ] Evidence-based priority ranking with implementation complexity
- [ ] Active maintenance and community support verification

## Information Retrieval Focus Areas

**Primary Interest Categories:**
- Web search and information retrieval engines
- Knowledge bases and documentation access
- Real-time information feeds and APIs
- Content processing and text analysis
- Database access and structured data retrieval
- Social media and news aggregation
- File and document management systems

**Secondary Interest Categories:**
- Development tools with information access capabilities
- Communication platforms with data export
- Analytics and monitoring with information extraction
- Enterprise systems with information APIs

## Research Methodology

**For Each Repository:**
1. **Initial Assessment** - Repository scope, maintenance, documentation quality
2. **Server Cataloging** - List all servers with basic metadata
3. **Relevance Filtering** - Identify information retrieval applicable servers
4. **Capability Analysis** - Document key features for relevant servers
5. **Implementation Assessment** - Setup complexity, dependencies, requirements
6. **Priority Assignment** - Rank servers for potential implementation

**Quality Verification:**
- Official documentation review
- Recent activity and maintenance status
- Community engagement and support
- Integration examples and use cases
- Performance and reliability indicators

## Expected Outcomes

**Comprehensive MCP Knowledge**: Complete understanding of ecosystem capabilities
**Informed Implementation**: Technology choices based on thorough analysis
**Risk Mitigation**: Avoid suboptimal technology selections due to incomplete information
**Scalable Foundation**: Build knowledge base that supports future expansion

## Timeline

**Immediate** (Next 1-2 weeks): High priority repository research
**Short-term** (Next 2-4 weeks): Medium priority repository research and analysis
**Medium-term** (Next 4-6 weeks): Complete capability matrix and implementation planning

Only after comprehensive discovery will we proceed to implementation decisions, ensuring the AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator is built on a solid foundation of ecosystem knowledge.
