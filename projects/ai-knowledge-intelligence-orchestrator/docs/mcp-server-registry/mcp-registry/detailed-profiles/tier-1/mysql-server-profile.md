## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Connection Problems**
```sql
-- Problem: Too many connections error
-- Solution: Optimize connection pooling and increase max_connections
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 2000;

-- Check current connections
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.threads WHERE type = 'FOREGROUND';
```

**Performance Issues**
```sql
-- Problem: Slow query performance
-- Solution: Analyze and optimize queries
SHOW SLOW_QUERIES;
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
ORDER BY avg_timer_wait DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Enable slow query log
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 1;
SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 1.0;
```

**Replication Issues**
```sql
-- Problem: Replication lag or failure
-- Solution: Monitor and troubleshoot replication
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
SHOW MASTER STATUS\G

-- Reset replication if needed
STOP SLAVE;
RESET SLAVE ALL;
-- Reconfigure replication...
START SLAVE;
```

### Monitoring and Diagnostics
```sql
-- Performance monitoring queries
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.file_summary_by_instance
WHERE file_name LIKE '%innodb%' ORDER BY total_latency DESC;

-- Check InnoDB status
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;

-- Monitor buffer pool usage
SELECT pool_id, pool_size, free_buffers, database_pages
FROM information_schema.innodb_buffer_pool_stats;
```
