import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('maritime_insurance.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create tables and insert data immediately
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS policies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    policy_number TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    vessel_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    coverage_amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    created_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
''')
```

```javascript
// Node.js with sqlite3 package
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();
const db = new sqlite3.Database('./data/claims.db');

// Immediate use without server setup
db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS claims (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    policy_id INTEGER,
    incident_date DATE,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    FOREIGN KEY (policy_id) REFERENCES policies (id)
)`);
```

#### Advanced Features Usage
```sql
-- JSON data handling (SQLite 3.38+)
CREATE TABLE vessel_data (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    vessel_info JSON,
    inspection_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO vessel_data (vessel_info) VALUES 
('{"name": "Sea Pioneer", "type": "cargo", "tonnage": 50000}');

-- Query JSON data
SELECT json_extract(vessel_info, '$.name') as vessel_name,
       json_extract(vessel_info, '$.tonnage') as tonnage
FROM vessel_data
WHERE json_extract(vessel_info, '$.type') = 'cargo';

-- Full-text search setup
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE policy_search USING fts5(
    policy_number, vessel_name, description
);

-- Window functions for analytics
SELECT policy_number,
       coverage_amount,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY coverage_amount DESC) as rank
FROM policies;
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Database Lock Errors**
```python
# Problem: Database locked during high concurrency
# Solution: Enable WAL mode and implement retry logic
import time
import sqlite3

def execute_with_retry(conn, query, params=None, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            if params:
                return conn.execute(query, params)
            return conn.execute(query)
        except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
            if "database is locked" in str(e) and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(0.1 * (2 ** attempt))  # Exponential backoff
                continue
            raise
```

**Performance Issues**
```sql
-- Problem: Slow query performance
-- Solution: Add appropriate indexes and analyze queries
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM policies WHERE vessel_name = 'Sea Pioneer';

-- Create missing indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_policies_vessel ON policies(vessel_name);

-- Update statistics
ANALYZE;
```

**Database Corruption**
```bash
# Problem: Database corruption
# Solution: Use built-in integrity check and recovery
sqlite3 database.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
sqlite3 database.db "PRAGMA quick_check;"

# Recovery from corruption
sqlite3 corrupted.db ".dump" | sqlite3 recovered.db
```

### Monitoring and Diagnostics
```sql
-- Check database size and page usage
PRAGMA page_count;
PRAGMA page_size;
PRAGMA freelist_count;

-- Analyze query performance
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT ...;
EXPLAIN SELECT ...;

-- Database statistics
.tables
.schema table_name
.indices table_name
```
