## Maritime Insurance Industry Applications

### Specialized Use Cases

**Legacy System Modernization:**
Maritime insurance companies typically operate substantial legacy systems built on COBOL, older Java frameworks, or custom mainframe applications. Aider's exceptional legacy code refactoring capabilities address critical modernization needs:

```python
# Example: Legacy maritime claims processing modernization
# Before: Monolithic COBOL-style processing
def process_maritime_claim(claim_data):
    # Legacy procedural approach
    validate_claim(claim_data)
    calculate_coverage(claim_data)
    generate_report(claim_data)
    
# After: Aider-assisted modernization to microservices
class MaritimeClaim:
    def __init__(self, claim_data):
        self.validator = ClaimValidator()
        self.calculator = CoverageCalculator()
        self.reporter = ReportGenerator()
    
    async def process(self):
        await self.validator.validate()
        coverage = await self.calculator.calculate()
        return await self.reporter.generate(coverage)
```

**Regulatory Compliance Automation:**
Maritime insurance faces complex international regulations (IMO, P&I Club rules, Lloyd's standards). Aider can automatically implement compliance patterns:

```typescript
// Automated regulatory compliance pattern implementation
interface IMOComplianceCheck {
  vesselType: VesselType;
  cargoCategory: CargoCategory;
  routeRegulations: RouteRegulation[];
  complianceStatus: ComplianceStatus;
}

class MaritimeRiskAssessment {
  async assessCompliance(vessel: Vessel): Promise<IMOComplianceCheck> {
    // Aider automatically generates compliance validation logic
    return this.complianceEngine.evaluate(vessel);
  }
}
```

**Real-Time Risk Calculation Systems:**
Maritime insurance requires complex real-time risk calculations based on weather, shipping routes, cargo values, and vessel conditions:

```python
# AI-assisted risk calculation engine development
class MaritimeRiskEngine:
    def calculate_dynamic_risk(self, voyage_data):
        """
        Aider helps implement sophisticated risk algorithms
        considering weather patterns, piracy zones, port conditions
        """
        risk_factors = self.analyze_route_risks(voyage_data.route)
        weather_risk = self.assess_weather_conditions(voyage_data.timeline)
        cargo_risk = self.evaluate_cargo_hazards(voyage_data.manifest)
        
        return self.composite_risk_score(risk_factors, weather_risk, cargo_risk)
```

### Industry-Specific Benefits

**Claims Processing Automation:**
- **60% faster claims processing** through automated code generation for claims workflows

# Optimized workflow with Aider MCP integration
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/maritime-risk-calculator

# 2. Claude Code delegates complex coding to Aider
# "Use Aider to implement risk calculation algorithm based on vessel type and route"

# 3. Aider generates code with automatic commits
# Commit messages: "feat: implement maritime risk calculation engine"

# 4. Claude Code reviews and provides strategic guidance
# 5. Developer performs final review and testing
# 6. Merge with confidence in AI-assisted quality
```
