The **4.0-point separation** between business and entertainment servers reflects the strategic decision to prioritize platforms that deliver measurable business outcomes.

**Business Recommendation**: **Carefully evaluate business case** before YouTube implementation. While some marketing and customer education applications exist, professional business communication platforms (Teams, Zoom, Loom) typically provide superior business value and professional features.
