## Conclusion

Spotify MCP Server has been **systematically demoted to Tier 4 Low-Priority** due to its pure entertainment consumption focus with zero business development or maritime insurance value. The **4.0-point separation** between business and entertainment servers reflects the strategic business decision to prioritize platforms that deliver measurable business outcomes.

**Strong Business Recommendation**: **Completely avoid Spotify implementation** for any business purposes. Entertainment platforms represent resource waste compared to business productivity tools that deliver measurable ROI and professional value.

**Entertainment Policy**: Music streaming should remain personal entertainment consumption outside business development resources and time allocation.
