## Error Learning Documentation: Session 2025-07-24

### Error Encountered During Git Operations
**Error**: `fatal: pathspec 'mcp-registry/detailed-profiles/tier-1/github-mcp-server-profile.md' did not match any files`

**Context**: When attempting to stage files for commit, I used incorrect file paths assuming the server profiles were in the `mcp-registry/` directory at the project root.

**Root Cause**: File location mismatch - the server profiles were initially created in `docs/mcp-server-registry/mcp-registry/detailed-profiles/tier-1/` but have been consolidated to `mcp-registry/detailed-profiles/tier-1/` location.

**Resolution**: 
1. Used `find` command to locate actual file paths: `find . -name "*mcp-server-profile.md" -type f`
2. Files have been consolidated from `docs/mcp-server-registry/mcp-registry/detailed-profiles/tier-1/` to `mcp-registry/detailed-profiles/tier-1/` structure
3. Updated file references to use consolidated paths: `mcp-registry/detailed-profiles/`

**Learning**: Always verify file locations with `find` or `ls` commands before attempting git operations, especially when working with complex directory structures. The Task tool may create files in different locations than expected based on the file organization logic.

**Prevention**: Use `git status` to see actual modified file paths before staging, and use shell commands to verify file existence and location before git operations.

### Process Improvement Applied
- Added systematic file verification step before git operations
- Used `find` command for comprehensive file location discovery
- Improved error recovery through iterative path correction
