    await axiomMcp.ingestEvents({
      dataset: "application-logs",
      events: batch
    });
    
    // Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the API
    await delay(100);
  }
};

// Efficient querying with time bounds
const optimizedQuery = {
  dataset: "application-logs",
  apl: `
    ['application-logs']
    | where _time >= ago(1h)  // Always include time bounds
    | where service == "user-service"  // Filter early
    | project _time, level, message, userId  // Project only needed fields
    | summarize count() by level, bin(_time, 5m)
    | order by _time desc
    | limit 100  // Limit result size
  `,
  // Use shorter time ranges for better performance
  startTime: "2024-01-01T23:00:00Z",
  endTime: "2024-01-01T23:59:59Z"
};

// Streaming queries for real-time monitoring
const streamingQuery = await axiomMcp.streamQuery({
  dataset: "application-logs",
  apl: `
    ['application-logs']
    | where _time >= ago(5m)
    | where level in ("error", "warn")
  `,
  onData: (data) => {
    // Process streaming results
    data.forEach(event => {
      if (event.level === "error") {
        triggerAlert(event);
      }
    });
  }
});
```
