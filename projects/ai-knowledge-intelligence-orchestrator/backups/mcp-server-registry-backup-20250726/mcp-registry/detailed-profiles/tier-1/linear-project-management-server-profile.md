  webhook: {
    events: ["pull_request", "push"],
    handler: async (event) => {
      if (event.type === "pull_request") {
        const issueId = extractIssueId(event.pull_request.title);
        if (issueId) {
          await linearMcp.updateIssue({
            issueId,
            stateId: "state_in_review",
            comment: `PR created: ${event.pull_request.html_url}`
          });
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

const slackNotification = async (issue) => {
  if (issue.priority === "urgent") {
    await slackMcp.sendMessage({
      channel: "#engineering",
      text: `ðŸš¨ Urgent issue created: ${issue.title}`,
      attachments: [{
        color: "danger",
        title: issue.title,
        title_link: issue.url,
        text: issue.description,
        fields: [
          { title: "Assignee", value: issue.assignee.name, short: true },
          { title: "Priority", value: issue.priority, short: true }
        ]
      }]
    });
  }
};
```

- **Real-time Updates**: <1 second propagation for live changes
- **Search Performance**: Sub-second search across large issue databases
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient batch processing for large data sets
- **Concurrent Users**: Unlimited concurrent users with consistent performance

### Scalability Considerations
- **Workspace Limits**: No practical limits on issues, projects, or team size
- **API Rate Limits**: 1000 requests per minute with burst capacity
- **Data Storage**: Unlimited issue history and attachment storage
- **Integration Scale**: Supports hundreds of webhook integrations
- **Global Performance**: CDN-backed global infrastructure for low latency

### Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Efficient bulk operations
const bulkIssueUpdate = async (issueIds, updates) => {
  const batches = chunk(issueIds, 50); // Process in batches
  
  for (const batch of batches) {
    const promises = batch.map(id => 
      linearMcp.updateIssue({ issueId: id, ...updates })
    );
    
    await Promise.all(promises);
    await delay(100); // Rate limiting
  }
};

// Smart caching for frequent queries
const cachedTeamQuery = memoize(
  async (teamId) => await linearMcp.getTeam(teamId),
  { maxAge: 300000 } // 5 minute cache
);

// Optimized webhook processing
const webhookProcessor = {
  queue: new Queue('linear-webhooks'),
  
  async process(event) {
    // Process webhooks asynchronously to avoid timeouts
    this.queue.add('process-event', event, {
      attempts: 3,
      backoff: 'exponential'
    });
  }
};
```
