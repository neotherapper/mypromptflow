      expr: 'instance:cpu_usage:rate5m',
      interval: '30s',
      maxDataPoints: 1000
    }
  ],
  options: {
    // Reduce query frequency for less critical panels
    minInterval: '30s',
    maxDataPoints: 1000
  }
};

// Efficient data source configuration
const dataSourceConfig = {
  name: "Optimized Prometheus",
  type: "prometheus",
  url: "http://prometheus:9090",
  jsonData: {
    timeInterval: "30s",
    queryTimeout: "60s",
    httpMethod: "POST"
  }
};

// Alert rule optimization
const efficientAlert = {
  name: "CPU Usage Alert",
  // Use pre-aggregated metrics
  query: 'instance:cpu_usage:rate5m > 0.8',
  evaluateEvery: '1m',
  forDuration: '5m' // Avoid alert flapping
};
```
