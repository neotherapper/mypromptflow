# Project: AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator

## Project Context

**Project Type**: AI Agent Framework Development
**Status**: Phase 2 - MCP Discovery & Knowledge Vault Integration  
**Priority**: High

## Project Summary

Create AI-powered information update system using intelligent agent orchestration to gather, process, validate, and integrate information from multiple sources with quality-assured adaptive processing pipeline.

**Goals**: Research information retrieval methods, design agent orchestration patterns, create quality assessment framework, develop adaptive scheduling, build storage solutions, establish knowledge-vault integration

**Success Criteria**: Comprehensive method catalog, proven coordination patterns, consistent quality framework, learning algorithms, RSS MVP implementation, clear integration architecture

## Quality Standards

**Research Quality Requirements**:
- Evidence-based analysis: 100% findings supported by documentation/testing
- Information currency: ≥95% sources from 2024-2025 timeframe  
- Practical applicability: ≥90% relevance to information processing use case
- Reproducibility: All methodologies produce consistent results

**Implementation Quality Metrics**:
- MCP server integration: ≥95% production readiness for Tier 1 servers
- Quality framework accuracy: ≥90% consistency across different AI agents
- Processing pipeline efficiency: ≤5 minutes for standard workflows
- Error recovery rate: ≥95% successful recovery from server failures

**Constraints**: Focus on AI agents with markdown/YAML storage, quality framework prioritized, integration with knowledge-vault deferred, reproducible solutions, gradual expansion capability

## AI Agent Instructions

**Core Mission**: Create intelligent information processing system using MCP servers and AI agent orchestration

**Work Instructions**:
1. **Project Purpose**: See `project-purpose.md` for detailed goals and comprehensive scope
2. **Current Tasks**: Check `task-list.md` for implementation priorities and dependencies  
3. **Progress Tracking**: Update `progress.md` with implementation achievements
4. **Research Integration**: Review `research-integration.md` for research context and applications

**MCP Registry Access**: Use comprehensive MCP server registry at `mcp-registry/detailed-profiles/` for server implementation guidance
- **Tier 1 Servers**: Immediate implementation priority (Fetch, Memory, Filesystem, Qdrant, GitHub, Redis)
- **Server Profiles**: Complete implementation guides with enterprise patterns and security compliance
- **Master Database**: Reference `mcp-registry/master-server-database.yaml` for comprehensive server catalog

**Implementation Focus**: Continuous MCP server discovery and evaluation, automated Knowledge Vault integration, tier-based server classification, quality framework automation

**Phase 2 Priorities**: 
- Automated GitHub scanning for new MCP servers
- Direct integration with Knowledge Vault database system
- Business value scoring and tier classification automation
- Quality standards enforcement for generic business language

**Industry Neutrality Requirement**: Use generic business language across all documentation - avoid domain-specific terminology

## Task Management

**Current Tasks**: Reference `task-list.md` for implementation priorities and dependencies
**Progress Tracking**: Update `progress.md` with implementation achievements and phase completion
**Research Integration**: See `research-integration.md` for research findings and application strategies

**Task Completion Protocol**:
1. **Mark Completed Tasks**: Update task status in `task-list.md` with completion timestamp and quality metrics
2. **Document Progress**: Add implementation progress to `progress.md` with specific achievements and outcomes
3. **Update MCP Registry**: Track server integration experiences and update relevant profiles
4. **Validate Quality Standards**: Ensure all implementations meet research and implementation quality thresholds
5. **Cross-Reference Updates**: Verify all file references remain accessible and current

**Implementation Phases**:
- **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Research and technical validation complete, MCP server ecosystem analysis finished
- **Phase 2 (Current)**: MCP discovery automation, Knowledge Vault integration, ongoing server evaluation and profiling
- **Phase 3 (Next)**: Information processing pipeline implementation with RSS feeds and adaptive scheduling
- **Phase 4 (Future)**: AI agent orchestration system deployment and production optimization
