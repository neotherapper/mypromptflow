## Key Transformations Applied

### Maritime → Generic Business Terminology Mapping

| Maritime Term | Generic Business Term |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Maritime Insurance | General Business Insurance |
| Vessel Management | Asset Management |
| Cargo Tracking | Inventory/Supply Chain Management |
| Port Operations | Facility/Warehouse Operations |
| Fleet Management | Equipment/Asset Management |
| Lloyd's of London | Industry Market Leader |
| P&I Clubs | Professional Industry Associations |

### Code Examples Transformation

#### Before (Maritime-Specific):
```typescript
class MaritimeClaimsWorkflow {
  async processNewClaim(claimData: NewClaimData): Promise<void> {
    const policyValidation = await claudeAlchemy.execute({
      query: `
        SELECT p.*, v.vessel_name, v.flag_state, v.classification_society
        FROM mysql:policies.vessel_policies p
        JOIN mysql:policies.vessel_details v ON p.vessel_id = v.vessel_id
        WHERE p.policy_number = ? AND p.status = 'ACTIVE'
      `,
      params: [claimData.policyNumber]
    });
  }
}
```

#### After (Generic Business):
```typescript
class BusinessClaimsWorkflow {
  async processNewClaim(claimData: NewClaimData): Promise<void> {
    const policyValidation = await claudeAlchemy.execute({
      query: `
        SELECT p.*, a.asset_name, a.registration_authority, a.certification_body
        FROM mysql:policies.asset_policies p
        JOIN mysql:policies.asset_details a ON p.asset_id = a.asset_id
        WHERE p.policy_number = ? AND p.status = 'ACTIVE'
      `,
      params: [claimData.policyNumber]
    });
  }
}
```

### Business Context Generalization

#### File-Specific Transformations:

**1. Claude Alchemy Multi-Database Platform**
- Transformed vessel risk assessment → asset risk assessment
- Updated maritime regulatory reporting → business regulatory reporting
- Changed IMO-based tracking → asset ID-based tracking
- Replaced Lloyd's market references → industry market leader

**2. ZenML MLOps Platform**
- Maritime vessel risk pipeline → business asset risk pipeline
- Vessel/route features → asset/operational features
- Maritime compliance validation → business compliance validation
- Lloyd's market requirements → industry market standards

**3. QuickBooks Server**
- Already largely generic, required minimal changes
- Updated sector references from "logistics" to "professional services"

**4. LexisNexis Server**
- Transportation insurance law → supply chain insurance law
- Maritime convention monitoring → labor standards monitoring
- Updated sector references for consistency

**5. Splunk Server**
- GPS/satellite tracking → RFID/barcode/IoT tracking
- Labor convention monitoring → labor standards monitoring
- Asset theft analysis updated for supply chain context

**6. Auth0 Server**
- Specialized market access → industry market access
- Classification society → certification body
- Already quite generic, minimal changes required

**7. Stripe Server**
- Specialized market integration → industry market integration
- Syndicate accounting → group accounting
- Maritime-specific payment standards → industry payment standards

## Technical Accuracy Validation

### Database Schema Updates
