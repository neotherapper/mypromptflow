## Conclusion

Discord MCP Server has been **systematically demoted to Tier 4 Low-Priority** due to its focus on gaming and entertainment rather than business development or maritime insurance operations. Despite strong technical capabilities, the **4.0-point separation** between business and entertainment servers reflects the strategic decision to prioritize business-aligned platforms.

**Business Recommendation**: **Avoid Discord implementation** unless explicit business case demonstrates maritime insurance value. Instead, prioritize Tier 1 business communication platforms (Teams, Slack, Google Workspace) that provide enterprise features, business integration, and measurable ROI.

**Resource Allocation**: Development resources should focus on **Tier 1-2 servers** that directly support development workflows and maritime insurance business operations for maximum business impact and ROI.
