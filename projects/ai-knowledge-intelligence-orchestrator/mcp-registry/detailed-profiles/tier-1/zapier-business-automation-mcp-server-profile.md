## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Implementation Challenges
```yaml
challenge_solutions:
  authentication_issues:
    issue: "Connection failures and authentication errors"
    solutions:
      - "Verify API credentials and permissions are current"
      - "Use OAuth connections for better security and reliability"
      - "Implement connection testing before deploying Zaps"
    best_practices:
      - "Regular rotation of API keys and credentials"
      - "Monitor connection health and renewal requirements"
      - "Document authentication requirements for each integration"
  
  data_transformation_challenges:
    issue: "Data format mismatches between applications"
    solutions:
      - "Use Formatter by Zapier for data transformation"
      - "Implement data validation steps before processing"
      - "Create lookup tables for data mapping and translation"
    best_practices:
      - "Standardize data formats across integrations"
      - "Implement comprehensive error handling for data issues"
      - "Use custom code steps for complex transformations"
  
  performance_optimization:
    issue: "Slow Zap execution or timeout errors"
    solutions:
      - "Use webhook triggers instead of polling where possible"
      - "Optimize filter conditions to reduce unnecessary processing"
      - "Implement batching for bulk operations"
    best_practices:
      - "Monitor Zap performance metrics regularly"
      - "Optimize API call frequency and batch sizes"
      - "Use delay steps strategically to prevent rate limiting"
```
