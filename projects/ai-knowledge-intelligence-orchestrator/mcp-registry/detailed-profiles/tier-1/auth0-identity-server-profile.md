    role: "Developer"
  },
  app_metadata: {
    permissions: ["read:users", "write:posts"]
  }
});

// Authentication and token management
const tokens = await auth0Mcp.authenticate({
  username: "user@example.com",
  password: "SecurePassword123!",
  connection: "Username-Password-Authentication",
  scope: "openid profile email"
});

// Organization management
await auth0Mcp.createOrganization({
  name: "Acme Corporation",
  display_name: "Acme Corp",
  branding: {
    logo_url: "https://acme.com/logo.png"
  },
  metadata: {
    industry: "Technology",
    size: "Enterprise"
  }
});

// Role and permission management
await auth0Mcp.assignRolesToUser({
  userId: "auth0|12345",
  roles: ["rol_admin", "rol_developer"]
});
```

### Advanced Identity Patterns

- **Adaptive Authentication**: Risk-based authentication with device fingerprinting
- **Passwordless Authentication**: Email magic links and SMS-based authentication
- **Step-up Authentication**: Additional verification for sensitive operations
- **Breached Password Detection**: Automatic detection and prevention of compromised passwords

## Integration Patterns

### Application Integration
```javascript
// React/Next.js integration
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client';

function Dashboard() {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, loginWithRedirect, logout } = useAuth0();
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Login</button>;
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => logout()}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// API authentication middleware
const auth0Middleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  
  try {
    const decoded = await auth0Mcp.verifyToken(token, {
      audience: 'https://your-api.example.com',
      issuer: 'https://your-tenant.auth0.com/'
    });
    
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
};
```

### Enterprise Integration Patterns
- **Active Directory Sync**: Bidirectional user synchronization with on-premises AD
- **SCIM Provisioning**: Automated user provisioning/deprovisioning from HR systems
- **Multi-Application SSO**: Single sign-on across multiple applications and services
- **Identity Federation**: Trust relationships with external identity providers
- **Compliance Workflows**: Audit trails and compliance reporting for identity operations

### Common Integration Scenarios
1. **Single Page Applications**: React, Vue, Angular with token-based authentication
2. **API Authorization**: Secure API endpoints with JWT token validation
3. **Enterprise SSO**: SAML/OIDC integration with existing enterprise systems
4. **Mobile Applications**: Native mobile apps with secure authentication flows
5. **B2B Multi-tenancy**: Organization-based user isolation and management

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Characteristics
- **Authentication Latency**: <100ms for login operations globally
- **Token Validation**: <10ms for JWT validation with caching
- **User Operations**: <200ms for user CRUD operations
- **SSO Performance**: <500ms for SAML/OIDC flows
- **Global Availability**: 99.9% uptime across 35+ edge locations

### Scalability Considerations
- **User Scale**: Supports millions of users per tenant
- **Authentication Volume**: Billions of authentications per month across platform
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Handles 100,000+ concurrent authentication requests
- **Geographic Distribution**: Global CDN with regional data residency options
- **Enterprise Load**: Tested with Fortune 500 companies and high-traffic applications

### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Token caching and refresh strategies
const tokenCache = new Map();

async function getCachedToken(userId) {
  const cached = tokenCache.get(userId);
  
  if (cached && cached.expiresAt > Date.now()) {
    return cached.token;
  }
  
  const newToken = await auth0Mcp.refreshToken(cached?.refreshToken);
  tokenCache.set(userId, {
    token: newToken.access_token,
    refreshToken: newToken.refresh_token,
    expiresAt: Date.now() + (newToken.expires_in * 1000)
  });
  
  return newToken.access_token;
}

// Batch user operations for efficiency
const batchUserUpdate = await auth0Mcp.batchUpdateUsers([
  { userId: 'user1', metadata: { department: 'Engineering' }},
  { userId: 'user2', metadata: { department: 'Marketing' }},
  { userId: 'user3', metadata: { department: 'Sales' }}
