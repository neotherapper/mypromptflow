# Claude Alchemy Multi-Database Platform - Enterprise Database Integration Guide

## How Insurance Companies Can Use This Generic Tool

This document outlines specific ways insurance companies can leverage the Claude Alchemy Multi-Database Platform for their unique business requirements across multiple industries. While the platform is a generic enterprise database integration tool, it offers powerful capabilities that can be adapted for insurance operations across financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and professional services sectors.

## Industry-Specific Use Cases

### Claims Management Automation

Insurance companies can use Claude Alchemy to integrate their claims management systems across multiple databases:

```typescript
// Maritime claims workflow using Claude Alchemy
class MaritimeClaimsWorkflow {
  async processNewClaim(claimData: NewClaimData): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Validate vessel policy across databases
    const policyValidation = await claudeAlchemy.execute({
      query: `
        SELECT p.*, v.vessel_name, v.flag_state, v.classification_society
        FROM mysql:policies.vessel_policies p
        JOIN mysql:policies.vessel_details v ON p.vessel_id = v.vessel_id
        WHERE p.policy_number = ? AND p.status = 'ACTIVE'
      `,
      params: [claimData.policyNumber]
    });
    
    // 2. Check maritime claims history from legacy Oracle
    const claimsHistory = await claudeAlchemy.query({
      database: "oracle:legacy",
      query: `
        SELECT COUNT(*) as prior_claims, SUM(loss_amt) as total_losses
        FROM claims_master 
        WHERE policy_no = ? AND incident_dt > ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -36)
      `,
      params: [claimData.policyNumber]
    });
    
    // 3. Create new maritime claim in PostgreSQL
    const newClaim = await claudeAlchemy.query({
      database: "postgresql:claims",
      query: `
        INSERT INTO maritime_claims (
          policy_number, vessel_name, incident_date, incident_location,
          loss_description, estimated_amount, status, created_by
        ) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, 'REPORTED', $7)
        RETURNING claim_id
      `,
      params: [
        claimData.policyNumber, policyValidation[0].vessel_name,
        claimData.incidentDate, claimData.location,
        claimData.description, claimData.estimatedAmount, claimData.reportedBy
      ]
    });
  }
}
```

### Maritime Regulatory Reporting

Maritime insurers can automate compliance reporting across multiple jurisdictions:

```typescript
// Multi-jurisdiction maritime regulatory reporting
class MaritimeRegulatoryReporting {
  async generateQuarterlyReports(): Promise<void> {
    // Lloyd's Market reporting for London market
    const lloydReports = await claudeAlchemy.execute({
      query: `
        SELECT 
          p.underwriter_code,
          COUNT(c.claim_id) as claim_count,
          SUM(c.claim_amount) as total_claims,
          AVG(c.claim_amount) as average_claim
        FROM postgresql:claims.maritime_claims c
        JOIN mysql:policies.vessel_policies p ON c.policy_number = p.policy_number
        WHERE c.incident_date >= date_trunc('quarter', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months')
        GROUP BY p.underwriter_code
      `,
      databases: ["postgresql:claims", "mysql:policies"]
    });
    
    // Flag state reporting for vessel registration authorities
    const flagStateReports = await claudeAlchemy.execute({
      query: `
        SELECT 
          v.flag_state,
          COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) as incidents,
          SUM(CASE WHEN c.incident_type = 'POLLUTION' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as pollution_incidents,
          SUM(CASE WHEN c.incident_type = 'COLLISION' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as collision_incidents
        FROM postgresql:claims.maritime_claims c
        JOIN mysql:policies.vessel_details v ON c.vessel_id = v.vessel_id
        GROUP BY v.flag_state
      `,
      databases: ["postgresql:claims", "mysql:policies"]
    });
  }
}
```

### Vessel Risk Assessment Integration

Maritime insurers can integrate vessel risk data from multiple sources:

```typescript
// Comprehensive vessel risk assessment
class VesselRiskAssessment {
  async assessVesselRisk(vesselData: VesselData): Promise<RiskScore> {
    // Combine vessel registry data, claims history, and market data
    const riskAssessment = await claudeAlchemy.execute({
      query: `
        SELECT 
          v.vessel_age,
          v.vessel_type,
          v.flag_state,
          COUNT(c.claim_id) as historical_claims,
          AVG(c.claim_amount) as average_claim_cost,
          r.route_risk_score
        FROM mysql:vessels.vessel_registry v
        LEFT JOIN postgresql:claims.vessel_claims c ON v.imo_number = c.imo_number
        LEFT JOIN oracle:risk.route_assessments r ON v.typical_route = r.route_id
        WHERE v.imo_number = ?
        GROUP BY v.vessel_age, v.vessel_type, v.flag_state, r.route_risk_score
      `,
      params: [vesselData.imoNumber],
      databases: ["mysql:vessels", "postgresql:claims", "oracle:risk"]
    });
    
    return this.calculateRiskScore(riskAssessment[0]);
  }
}
```

### Maritime Financial Reconciliation

Maritime insurers can reconcile premiums, claims, and reinsurance across systems:

```typescript
// Maritime-specific financial reconciliation
class MaritimeFinancialReconciliation {
  async performMonthlyReconciliation(): Promise<ReconciliationReport> {
    const reconciliation = await claudeAlchemy.beginTransaction([
      "postgresql:claims",
      "mssql:financials", 
      "mysql:policies"
    ]);
    
    try {
      // Maritime claims paid
      const claimsPaid = await claudeAlchemy.query({
        database: "postgresql:claims",
        transaction: reconciliation,
        query: `
          SELECT 
            SUM(payment_amount) as total_claims_paid,
            COUNT(*) as claims_count
          FROM maritime_claims 
          WHERE payment_date >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month')
            AND status = 'PAID'
        `
      });
      
      // Premium collections from policy system
      const premiumCollections = await claudeAlchemy.query({
        database: "mysql:policies",
        transaction: reconciliation,
        query: `
          SELECT 
            SUM(premium_amount) as total_premiums,
            COUNT(*) as premium_count
          FROM vessel_premium_transactions
          WHERE transaction_date >= DATE_FORMAT(DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH), '%Y-%m-01')
            AND status = 'COLLECTED'
        `
      });
      
      await claudeAlchemy.commitTransaction(reconciliation);
      
      return {
        claimsPaid: claimsPaid[0],
        premiumCollections: premiumCollections[0],
        reconciled: this.validateMaritimeReconciliation(claimsPaid[0], premiumCollections[0])
      };
    } catch (error) {
      await claudeAlchemy.rollbackTransaction(reconciliation);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
