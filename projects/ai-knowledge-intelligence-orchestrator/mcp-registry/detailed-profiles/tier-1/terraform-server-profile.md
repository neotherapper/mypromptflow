- Validate IAM roles and policies for required permissions
- Test credentials outside Terraform to isolate issues

#### Resource Drift and Inconsistencies
**Symptoms**: Terraform plan shows unexpected changes
**Solutions**:
- Run `terraform refresh` to update state with current resources
- Investigate manual changes made outside Terraform
- Use import commands to bring existing resources under management
