const workos = new WorkOS(process.env.WORKOS_API_KEY);

// Middleware for B2B authentication
export async function authenticateB2BUser(req, res, next) {
  const { code, state, organization_id } = req.query;
  
  try {
    const profile = await workos.sso.getProfile({
      code,
      clientId: process.env.WORKOS_CLIENT_ID
    });
    
    const user = {
      id: profile.id,
      email: profile.email,
      firstName: profile.firstName,
      lastName: profile.lastName,
      organizationId: profile.organizationId,
      role: profile.role || 'member'
    };
    
    req.user = user;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication failed' });
  }
}

// Organization-based access control
function requireOrganization(organizationId) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.user.organizationId !== organizationId) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' });
    }
    next();
  };
}
```

### Enterprise Customer Onboarding
```javascript
// Self-service enterprise setup flow
async function onboardEnterpriseCustomer(customerData) {
  // Create organization
  const organization = await workosMcp.createOrganization({
    name: customerData.companyName,
    domains: customerData.domains
  });
  
  // Generate admin portal for SSO setup
  const portalLink = await workosMcp.generatePortalLink({
    organizationId: organization.id,
    intent: 'sso',
    returnUrl: `${customerData.appUrl}/onboarding/complete`
  });
  
  // Send setup instructions to customer admin
  await sendOnboardingEmail({
    to: customerData.adminEmail,
    portalLink: portalLink.link,
    organizationId: organization.id
  });
  
  return organization;
}
```
