## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Database Lock Errors**
```python
# Problem: Database locked during high concurrency
# Solution: Enable WAL mode and implement retry logic
import time
import sqlite3

def execute_with_retry(conn, query, params=None, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            if params:
                return conn.execute(query, params)
            return conn.execute(query)
        except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
            if "database is locked" in str(e) and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(0.1 * (2 ** attempt))  # Exponential backoff
                continue
            raise
```

**Performance Issues**
```sql
-- Problem: Slow query performance
-- Solution: Add appropriate indexes and analyze queries
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name = 'Enterprise Software';

-- Create missing indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_name ON products(product_name);

-- Update statistics
ANALYZE;
```

**Database Corruption**
```bash
# Problem: Database corruption
# Solution: Use built-in integrity check and recovery
sqlite3 database.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
sqlite3 database.db "PRAGMA quick_check;"

# Recovery from corruption
sqlite3 corrupted.db ".dump" | sqlite3 recovered.db
```

### Monitoring and Diagnostics
```sql
-- Check database size and page usage
PRAGMA page_count;
PRAGMA page_size;
PRAGMA freelist_count;

-- Analyze query performance
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT ...;
EXPLAIN SELECT ...;

-- Database statistics
.tables
.schema table_name
.indices table_name
```
