### Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Efficient data fetching with GraphQL fragments
const ISSUE_FRAGMENT = `
  fragment IssueDetails on Issue {
    id
    number
    title
    description
    priority
    estimate
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    url
    state {
      id
      name
      type
    }
    assignee {
      id
      name
      email
    }
    team {
      id
      name
      key
    }
    labels {
      nodes {
        id
        name
        color
      }
    }
  }
`;

// Batch operations for efficiency
const batchUpdateIssues = async (updates) => {
  const mutations = updates.map((update, index) => ({
    query: `
      mutation UpdateIssue${index}($input: IssueUpdateInput!) {
        issueUpdate(input: $input) {
          success
          issue {
            ...IssueDetails
          }
        }
      }
      ${ISSUE_FRAGMENT}
    `,
    variables: { input: update }
  }));
  
  // Execute mutations in parallel
  const results = await Promise.all(
    mutations.map(mutation => linearMcp.request(mutation))
  );
  
  return results;
};

// Smart caching strategy
class LinearCache {
  constructor(ttl = 300000) { // 5 minutes
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.ttl = ttl;
  }
  
  async get(key, fetcher) {
    const cached = this.cache.get(key);
    
    if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < this.ttl) {
      return cached.data;
    }
    
    const data = await fetcher();
    this.cache.set(key, {
      data,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
    
    return data;
  }
  
  invalidate(pattern) {
    for (const [key] of this.cache) {
      if (key.includes(pattern)) {
        this.cache.delete(key);
      }
    }
  }
}
```
