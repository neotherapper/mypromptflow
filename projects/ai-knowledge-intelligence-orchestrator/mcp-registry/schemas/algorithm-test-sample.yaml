# Next Steps After Validation
post_validation_actions:
  - "If test results match expectations, deploy to full database"
  - "If discrepancies found, adjust algorithm weights and retest"
  - "Create audit trail of all score changes"
  - "Deploy specialist sub-agents for full re-ranking"
  - "Update detailed profiles with new tier classifications"
