# Project: AI Knowledge Lifecycle Orchestrator

## Project Context

**Project Type**: Intelligent Knowledge Management System
**Status**: Phase 1 - Active Development (Dependency Mapping & Detection)
**Priority**: Critical - Solves outdated information problem across all AI systems

## Project Summary

Create an intelligent system that automatically detects changes in technology sources (React updates, tool releases, framework changes) and propagates those updates through all dependent AI agent instructions, ensuring AI agents always provide current information instead of outdated examples.

**Goals**: 
- Eliminate outdated AI agent responses (e.g., React 18 examples when React 19 available)
- Create dependency mapping between AI files and their knowledge sources
- Implement automated change detection for critical technologies
- Build update pipeline that revalidates and updates dependent AI instructions
- Enhance PR validation with context-aware current knowledge

**Success Criteria**: 
- Zero outdated technology examples in AI agent responses
- Automated dependency mapping covering 100% of AI agent instruction files
- Change detection for top 50 critical technologies with 95% accuracy
- Automated update pipeline with <24h propagation time for critical changes
- Enhanced PR validation using current technology versions and best practices

**Approach**: Four-phase implementation starting with dependency mapping, then building change detection, update pipeline, and PR enhancement systems

**Constraints**: 
- Must integrate with existing Knowledge Vault, AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence, and MCP Server registry
- Cannot break existing AI agent functionality during updates
- Must maintain quality standards equivalent to existing validation frameworks
- Updates require approval gates for critical changes

## Current Status: Phase 1 Active Development

**Progress**: Project structure created, beginning dependency mapping implementation

**Active Work**: Creating dependency registry schema and automated scanner for existing AI files

**Integration Points**:
- **Knowledge Vault**: Storage system for updated technology information
- **AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence**: Framework for validating and updating instructions
- **AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator**: Source of MCP servers and information retrieval methods
- **AI PR Validation System**: Target for enhanced context-aware validation
