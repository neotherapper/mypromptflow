# AI Knowledge Lifecycle Orchestrator - Project Purpose

## Project Vision

Create an intelligent, automated system that eliminates outdated information in AI agent responses by continuously monitoring technology sources, detecting changes, and propagating updates through all dependent AI instructions in real-time.

## Problem Statement

### The Outdated Information Challenge

**Current Issue**: AI agents frequently provide outdated examples and recommendations (e.g., React 18 patterns when React 19 is current, deprecated tool configurations, obsolete best practices) because there's no systematic way to keep AI knowledge current with rapid technology evolution.

**Impact**: 
- Development teams receive incorrect guidance during PR reviews
- AI-generated code uses deprecated patterns and libraries
- Manual effort required to constantly update AI instructions
- Inconsistent technology recommendations across different AI agents
- Reduced trust in AI assistance due to outdated information

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **No Dependency Tracking**: AI instruction files don't explicitly track which technologies they depend on
2. **Manual Update Process**: Technology changes require manual identification and updating of affected files
3. **Fragmented Knowledge Sources**: Information scattered across multiple projects without central coordination
4. **No Change Detection**: No automated monitoring of technology sources for updates
5. **Cascade Effect**: When one technology updates, related instructions in multiple files need updating

## Project Goals
