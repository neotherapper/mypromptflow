# Document Templates: Blueprints for Structured Content

Document templates are specialized prompts that serve as blueprints for specific types of documents within the AI Knowledge Base. They define the expected structure, sections, and metadata for a particular document, ensuring consistency, completeness, and adherence to predefined standards across all generated content of that type. These templates are crucial for maintaining a uniform and high-quality knowledge base.

## Purpose and Functionality

*   **Standardization**: They enforce a consistent structure and format for all documents of a given type, making the knowledge base predictable and easy to navigate.
*   **Content Guidance**: They provide clear guidelines for the AI on what information to include in each section, reducing the likelihood of omissions or irrelevant content.
*   **Metadata Enforcement**: They ensure that essential metadata (e.g., document type, version, dependencies, status) is consistently captured through YAML frontmatter.
*   **AI Agent Instructions**: They can embed specific instructions for AI agents on how to use or interact with the generated document during subsequent workflows (e.g., for implementation guidance or validation).
*   **Efficiency**: By providing a predefined structure, they streamline the document generation process, allowing AI agents to focus on content creation rather than structural design.

## Example: `ai/prompts/document-templates/tier2/prd.md`

This template provides the complete structure for a Product Requirements Document (PRD). It includes YAML frontmatter with metadata, standard sections like "Executive Summary," "Problem Statement," "Functional Requirements," and "Success Metrics," and even specifies how AI agents should use the document during implementation. This template ensures that every PRD generated by the system will have a consistent and comprehensive structure.

# Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

{High-level product vision and goals}

## Problem Statement

{What problem does this solve?}

## Target Users

{Primary and secondary user segments}

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. **{Feature Name}**
   - Description: {description}
   - User Story: As a {user}, I want {goal} so that {benefit}
   - Priority: P0/P1/P2
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] {criterion}

### User Flows

{Key user journeys through the product}

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- {Requirement}: {Target metric}

### Security

- {Security requirement}

### Scalability

- {Scalability requirement}

## Success Metrics

- {Metric}: {Target} by {Timeline}

## MVP Scope

{What's included in the first release}

## Future Considerations

{Features for future releases}

## AI Agent Instructions

When implementing features from this PRD:

1. Start with P0 features
2. Reference user stories for context
3. Validate against acceptance criteria
4. Track success metrics in implementation
```
```

## Key Elements of Document Templates

*   **YAML Frontmatter**: Defines essential metadata for the document, including its type, version, creation date, dependencies, and status. This metadata is crucial for document management and searchability.
*   **Structured Sections**: Clearly outlines the main sections and sub-sections of the document, often with placeholders for content to be filled by the AI.
*   **AI Agent Instructions**: Provides specific guidance to AI agents on how to interpret and utilize the document's content, especially in downstream processes like feature implementation.
*   **Cross-referencing**: Encourages the use of `@ai/knowledge/` paths to link to related documents, fostering a highly interconnected knowledge base.
*   **Code Examples**: Specifies where and how to include relevant code examples (e.g., TypeScript), making the documentation more practical and actionable for developers.
