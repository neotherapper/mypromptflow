# AI Research Framework Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the AI Research Framework, a sophisticated system designed to automate and elevate the process of conducting research within the AI Knowledge Base project.

## 1. Purpose and Vision

The mission of the AI Research Framework is to transform our collection of documents into an interconnected, actionable intelligence network. It aims to bridge the gap between knowledge generation and knowledge utilization, enabling AI systems to consume, connect, and reason with accumulated knowledge over time.

The core objectives are:
*   **Advanced Meta-Prompting Orchestration**: Dynamically select and combine research techniques based on context, quality, and goals.
*   **Cognitive Research Framework**: Implement a "Knowledge Fabric" that turns static documents into a dynamic, interconnected knowledge base.
*   **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Establish a framework with robust validation, quality assurance, and human-AI collaboration protocols.

## 2. Core Components

The framework is built on several key pillars that work together to produce high-quality, validated, and interconnected research.

### 2.1. Meta-Prompt Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is the "brain" of the research process. Instead of relying on static prompts, it intelligently selects, combines, and sequences the best research methodologies based on the specific task.

*   **Location**: `research/orchestrator/`
*   **Functionality**:
    *   **Context Analysis**: Analyzes a research request's complexity, domain, and quality requirements.
    *   **Dynamic Method Selection**: Chooses from a registry of over 15 meta-prompting techniques (e.g., `Tree of Thoughts`, `Constitutional AI`, `Multi-Perspective Approach`).
    *   **Execution Engine**: Manages the research workflow, supporting parallel, sequential, and hybrid execution patterns.
    *   **Quality Monitoring**: Continuously assesses output quality and can trigger improvements.
*   **Interaction**: Users can trigger the orchestrator via the `/orchestrate-research` Claude command.

### 2.2. The Knowledge Fabric (Cognitive Research Framework)

The Knowledge Fabric addresses the problem of "knowledge amnesia" by transforming the project's documents into a queryable, interconnected knowledge base for AI agents.

*   **Location**: The concepts are described in `projects/research/03-cognitive-research-framework.md` and `research/findings/framework-analysis/cognitive_research_framework_design.md`.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   **AI Knowledge Indexing**: A vector database (e.g., ChromaDB/FAISS) indexes all content for powerful semantic search, allowing the AI to find conceptually related information.
    *   **Semantic Metadata Graph**: An enhanced metadata schema links documents by concepts, dependencies, and contributions, enabling structured queries.
    *   **Knowledge Surfacing API**: A dedicated tool (`knowledge.search`) allows AI agents to query the fabric using a combination of semantic (meaning-based) and structured (tag-based) search.

### 2.3. Validation and Quality Assurance Framework

To ensure the reliability and academic rigor of the research produced, the framework incorporates a comprehensive validation and QA system. This addresses critical gaps identified in standard AI research workflows.

*   **Location**: Described in `research/findings/framework-analysis/comprehensive-ai-research-framework-gaps-and-recommendations.md`.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   **Empirical Validation**: Implements standards (like NIST AI TEVV) for benchmarking research quality.
    *   **Automated QA**: Integrates automated fact-checking and source credibility assessment.
    *   **Reproducibility**: Includes infrastructure for provenance tracking, version control, and environment documentation to ensure research can be replicated.
    *   **Human-AI Collaboration**: Defines clear protocols and intervention points for human experts to guide and validate the AI's work.

## 3. Key Workflow: Orchestrated Research

The primary workflow for using the framework is initiated through a Claude command.

1.  **Initiation**: A user issues a research request using the `/orchestrate-research "[topic]"` command.
2.  **Context Analysis**: The **Meta-Prompt Orchestrator** analyzes the request to determine its complexity, domain, quality needs, and constraints.
3.  **Method Selection**: The Orchestrator selects the optimal combination of primary, enhancement, and quality assurance methods from its registry.
4.  **Execution**: The Orchestrator executes the selected methods, potentially in parallel or sequence, while monitoring quality. If the **Knowledge Fabric** is implemented, the AI agents will first query it to gather relevant internal context before proceeding with external research.
5.  **Synthesis & Validation**: The results from the different methods are synthesized into a coherent output. The **Validation Framework** ensures the final product is accurate, reliable, and reproducible.
6.  **Output**: The system delivers a comprehensive research document, complete with a summary of the methods used and the confidence level of the findings.

## 4. Conclusion

The AI Research Framework is a forward-thinking system designed to move beyond simple document generation towards a cognitive architecture where AI can learn, reason, and build upon a persistent, interconnected body of knowledge. It provides the foundation for producing expert-level, production-grade research that is reliable, scalable, and transparent.
