# AI Prompts Overview: Guiding the Knowledge Base Generation

This document provides a high-level overview of the AI prompt system within the AI Knowledge Base project. Prompts are essential for guiding AI agents in generating, structuring, and validating content. For detailed explanations of each prompt category, please refer to the dedicated documents within the `docs/ai_prompts/` directory.

## 1. Role of Prompts

Prompts in this system are sophisticated configurations that define:

*   **AI Agent Behavior**: How an AI agent should think, reason, and approach a task.
*   **Content Structure**: The required format, sections, and metadata for generated documents.
*   **Workflow Steps**: The sequence of operations an AI agent should follow to complete a task.
*   **Contextual Information**: How AI agents should leverage existing knowledge and dependencies.

## 2. Prompt Categories

The `ai/prompts` directory is organized into several categories, each serving a distinct purpose in the documentation generation process. Click on the links below for a detailed explanation of each category:

*   **General Workflow Prompts**: See [General Workflow Prompts](general_workflow_prompts.md)
*   **Meta-Prompts (AI Behavior)**: See [Meta-Prompts (AI Behavior)](meta_prompts_ai_behavior.md)
*   **Meta-Prompts (Orchestration)**: See [Meta-Prompts (Orchestration)](meta_prompts_orchestration.md)
*   **Document Templates**: See [Document Templates](document_templates.md)

## 3. Conclusion

The AI prompt system is a sophisticated and integral part of the AI Knowledge Base project. This modular approach allows for flexibility in defining AI behavior and scalability in generating diverse document types, making the overall system robust and efficient.
