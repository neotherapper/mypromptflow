# Knowledge Vault - Human Access Only

⚠️ **AI AGENT RESTRICTION ZONE** ⚠️

**CRITICAL**: AI agents should NOT access knowledge-vault files during normal operations.

## Purpose
This directory contains human knowledge that can cause cognitive contamination in AI agents:
- Research findings and academic validation
- Performance metrics and effectiveness statistics  
- Success stories and case studies
- Implementation reports and assessments
- Academic justification and research validation

## Access Policy
- **Normal Operations**: AI agents must NOT access these files
- **Research Tasks**: Only when explicitly instructed by humans
- **Reporting Tasks**: Only when specifically requested for human consumption

## Cognitive Contamination Warning
**Proven Risk**: Academic knowledge mixed with AI agent instructions causes:
- Fiction generation instead of factual reporting
- Academic creep in operational tasks
- Performance metric fabrication
- Instruction pollution with irrelevant research content

## Directory Structure
- `ai-instruction-framework/` - Framework research outcomes and case studies
- `research-framework/` - Research methodology findings and validation  
- `project-outcomes/` - Success metrics and effectiveness assessments

## For AI Agents
**Use only the actionable instruction files outside knowledge-vault.**
**These files contain human knowledge, not AI agent commands.**
