# Common Pitfalls to Avoid
pitfalls:
  
  overengineering:
    mistake: "Starting with complex distributed systems"
    solution: "Begin with Filesystem, Fetch, Memory"
    
  ignoring_monitoring:
    mistake: "No error tracking from day one"
    solution: "Install Sentry immediately (15 min setup)"
    
  premature_optimization:
    mistake: "Adding caching before measuring"
    solution: "Measure first, then add Redis if needed"
    
  complex_databases:
    mistake: "Starting with complex NoSQL setups"
    solution: "SQLite first, PostgreSQL when needed"
