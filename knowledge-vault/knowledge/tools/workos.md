## API Integration Architecture

### **Authentication Flow Implementation**

**OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow**:
```typescript
// WorkOS authentication integration
import { WorkOS } from '@workos-inc/node';

const workos = new WorkOS(process.env.WORKOS_API_KEY);

// Initiate authentication
export async function initiateAuth(request: Request) {
  const authorizationUrl = workos.sso.getAuthorizationUrl({
    clientId: process.env.WORKOS_CLIENT_ID,
    domain: 'your-company.com',
    redirectUri: 'https://your-app.com/callback',
    state: generateSecureState()
  });
  
  return redirect(authorizationUrl);
}

// Handle authentication callback
export async function handleCallback(request: Request) {
  const { code, state } = extractParams(request);
  
  const profile = await workos.sso.getProfile({
    code,
    clientId: process.env.WORKOS_CLIENT_ID
  });
  
  // Create session and redirect to application
  return createUserSession(profile);
}
```

**Directory Sync Integration**:
```python
# Python SDK for user provisioning automation
import workos

workos.api_key = os.getenv('WORKOS_API_KEY')

# Automated user provisioning
class UserProvisioningHandler:
    def handle_user_created(self, event_data):
        user_profile = event_data['data']
        
        # Create user in application database
        app_user = create_application_user({
            'workos_id': user_profile['id'],
            'email': user_profile['email'],
            'first_name': user_profile['first_name'],
            'last_name': user_profile['last_name'],
            'organization_id': user_profile['organization_id']
        })
        
        # Set up application-specific permissions
        assign_default_permissions(app_user)
        
        # Send welcome notification
        send_welcome_email(app_user)
```

### **Advanced Integration Patterns**

**Multi-Tenant Organization Management**:
```javascript
// Organization-based access control
const OrganizationManager = {
  async createOrganization(orgData) {
    const organization = await workos.organizations.createOrganization({
      name: orgData.name,
      domains: orgData.domains,
      allow_profiles_outside_organization: false
    });
    
    // Set up organization-specific configuration
    await this.configureOrganizationSettings(organization.id, orgData.settings);
    
    return organization;
  },
  
  async setupSSO(organizationId, ssoConfig) {
    const connection = await workos.sso.createConnection({
      source: 'saml',
      organization_id: organizationId,
      idp_metadata: ssoConfig.metadata
    });
    
    return connection;
  }
};
```

**Webhook Event Processing**:
```typescript
// Real-time event handling for user lifecycle
interface WorkOSWebhookEvent {
  id: string;
  event: string;
  data: {
    id: string;
    organization_id?: string;
    connection_id?: string;
    directory_id?: string;
  };
  created_at: string;
}

export async function handleWebhook(event: WorkOSWebhookEvent) {
  switch (event.event) {
    case 'user.created':
      await onUserCreated(event.data);
      break;
    case 'user.updated':
      await onUserUpdated(event.data);
      break;
    case 'user.deleted':
      await onUserDeleted(event.data);
      break;
    case 'organization.created':
      await onOrganizationCreated(event.data);
      break;
  }
}
```
