# Integration Patterns: Cross-Framework Coordination

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive integration patterns for coordinating Claude Code's four major AI frameworks: Information Access, Research Orchestrator, Meta-Prompting, and Validation Systems. These patterns enable sophisticated multi-framework workflows while maintaining context isolation, quality standards, and optimal resource utilization.
