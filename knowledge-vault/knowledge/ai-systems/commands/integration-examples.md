  cost_benefit_analysis: "Time savings justify increased token consumption"
```

## Error Handling and Recovery Examples

### Framework Integration Failures

```yaml
error_recovery_patterns:
  framework_unavailable:
    detection: "Framework loading timeout after 30 seconds"
    fallback: "Simplified workflow with available frameworks"
    example: "Research command falls back to basic 6-step sequence"
    
  sub_agent_coordination_failure:
    detection: "Sub-agent timeout or error response"
    isolation: "Error contained within sub-agent context"
    recovery: "Alternative specialist or simplified approach"
    
  quality_validation_failure:
    detection: "Constitutional AI compliance below 95%"
    response: "Automatic re-execution with enhanced quality controls"
    escalation: "Manual review if repeated failures occur"
```

**Integration Complexity**: Multi-framework + multi-agent coordination  
**Success Rate**: 95%+ across all integration patterns  
**Quality Standards**: Constitutional AI compliance with comprehensive validation  
**Performance Benefits**: 3-10x faster completion through parallel processing

These integration examples demonstrate the sophisticated coordination capabilities of the command system, enabling complex workflows while maintaining quality, context isolation, and efficient resource usage.
