# MCP Research Intelligence Framework

## Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Research Intelligence enables research frameworks to intelligently coordinate domain-specific information sources through automated server selection, priority mapping, and intelligent routing. This analysis extracts patterns from the comprehensive MCP registry (2,200+ servers, 142 detailed profiles) to create research-specific intelligence systems.

## Core Intelligence Architecture

### Domain-Specific Server Mapping

**Research Domain Classification**:

  technical_documentation:
    primary_servers: ["github", "aws_docs", "filesystem", "git"]  
    supplementary: ["memory", "fetch", "redis"]
    use_cases: ["api_documentation", "code_examples", "technical_guides"]

### Intelligence Coordination Patterns

#### Progressive Server Selection
```yaml
intelligent_coordination:
  step_1_primary_assessment:
    trigger: "Research topic analysis"
    action: "Select 2-3 primary servers based on domain classification"
    fallback: "Default to Anthropic trio (Fetch, Memory, Filesystem)"
    
  step_2_supplementary_routing:
    trigger: "Primary server results insufficient"
    action: "Add specialized servers based on information gaps"
    examples: "Academic → arXiv/PubMed, Technical → GitHub/Git"
    
  step_3_adaptive_expansion:
    trigger: "Research complexity requires broader sources"
    action: "Expand to Tier 2 servers with relevance scoring"
    constraint: "Maximum 7 servers to prevent coordination complexity"
```

#### MCP Availability Intelligence
```yaml
server_availability_scoring:
  setup_complexity_weighting:
    score_10_no_dependencies: ["fetch", "memory", "everything", "filesystem"]
    score_8_9_simple_setup: ["git", "sentry", "linear"] 
    score_6_7_moderate_setup: ["qdrant", "redis", "slack_mcp", "chroma"]

  multi_perspective_approach:
    quantitative_agent: ["bright_data", "reddit", "fetch", "memory"]
    qualitative_agent: ["slack_mcp", "linear", "github", "memory"]

### Practical Implementation Patterns

#### Research Context Detection
```python
# Example intelligent server selection logic
research_context_analysis = {
    "academic_keywords": ["paper", "research", "study", "journal", "citation"],
    "technical_keywords": ["api", "documentation", "code", "implementation", "framework"],
    "business_keywords": ["market", "competitive", "strategy", "analysis", "trends"],
    "infrastructure_keywords": ["architecture", "performance", "monitoring", "deployment"]
}

def select_research_servers(research_topic, complexity_level):
    # 1. Analyze topic for domain classification
    domain = classify_research_domain(research_topic)
    
    # 2. Select primary servers based on domain
    primary_servers = domain_mappings[domain]["primary_servers"]
    
    # 3. Filter by availability and setup complexity
    available_servers = filter_by_availability(primary_servers)
    
    # 4. Add supplementary servers based on complexity
    if complexity_level == "complex":
        available_servers.extend(domain_mappings[domain]["supplementary"])
    
    # 5. Limit to maximum 7 servers for coordination efficiency
    return available_servers[:7]
```

#### Error Recovery and Fallback
```yaml
mcp_intelligence_fallbacks:
  server_unavailable:
    strategy: "Intelligent routing to equivalent capability servers"
    example: "qdrant_unavailable → chroma OR redis"
    
  authentication_failure:
    strategy: "Fallback to public APIs and fetch operations"
    example: "github_private → github_public OR fetch"
    
  rate_limiting:
    strategy: "Rotate through equivalent servers with delays"
    example: "arxiv_limited → semantic_scholar → pubmed"
    
  complexity_overload:
    strategy: "Reduce server count while maintaining core capabilities"
    priority: "Maintain Anthropic trio + 1-2 domain-specific servers"
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Server Coordination Efficiency
```yaml
coordination_optimization:
  parallel_execution:
    optimal_concurrency: "3-4 servers maximum for parallel access"
    sequential_fallback: "Complex queries with dependency chains"
    
  caching_strategy:
    memory_server_integration: "Persistent cross-session knowledge"
    redis_caching: "High-performance temporary data"

    tier_1_primary: "Handle 70% of research queries"
    tier_2_supplementary: "Handle specialized domain queries"
    tier_3_fallback: "Handle overflow and niche requirements"
```

### Quality Assurance Integration

#### MCP-Enhanced Validation
```yaml

  source_diversity_validation:
    requirement: "Minimum 3 different server types for cross-validation"
    example: "official_api + community_source + academic_database"
    
  information_freshness:
    real_time_sources: ["fetch", "bright_data", "redis"]
    static_sources: ["filesystem", "memory", "git"]
    academic_sources: ["arxiv", "pubmed", "semantic_scholar"]
    
  authority_verification:
    tier_1_authoritative: "Anthropic official servers"
