# AI Frameworks: Core System Documentation

## Overview

This section consolidates documentation for the four major AI frameworks that power the advanced multi-agent coordination system: Information Access, Research Orchestrator, Meta-Prompting, and Validation Systems. These frameworks work together to provide comprehensive AI-assisted development and research capabilities.

## Framework Integration Patterns

### Sequential Framework Usage
```yaml
research_workflow:
  step_1: "Information Access → Source discovery and coordination"
  step_2: "Research Orchestrator → Method selection and execution"
  step_3: "Validation Systems → Quality assurance and compliance"
  step_4: "Meta-Prompting → Continuous improvement integration"
```

### Parallel Framework Coordination
```yaml
complex_analysis:
  parallel_execution:
    information_specialist: "Multi-source coordination via Information Access"
    research_specialist: "15-method research via Research Orchestrator" 
    validation_specialists: "Quality assurance via Validation Systems"
    optimization_layer: "Performance improvement via Meta-Prompting"
```

### Adaptive Framework Selection
```yaml
context_aware_routing:
  simple_queries: "Information Access only"
  research_needs: "Information Access + Research Orchestrator"
  quality_critical: "All frameworks with validation emphasis"
  optimization_focused: "Meta-Prompting with supporting frameworks"
```
