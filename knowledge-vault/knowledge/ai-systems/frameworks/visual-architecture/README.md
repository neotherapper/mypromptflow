## Architecture Principles

### Tree-Leaf Design Pattern
```
Tree Agents (Claude Code): Can spawn subagents ‚Üí Multi-agent methods
Leaf Agents (Gemini): Cannot spawn subagents ‚Üí Enhanced single prompts
```

### Universal Research Outcomes
Both tree and leaf execution paths produce equivalent research quality through:
- **Tree Path**: Parallel specialized agents with coordination
- **Leaf Path**: Enhanced prompts with comprehensive analysis templates

### MCP Intelligence Integration
All methods coordinate with domain-specific MCP servers:
- **Academic Research**: arXiv, Semantic Scholar, PubMed
- **Technical Documentation**: GitHub, Git, Filesystem
- **Business Intelligence**: Bright Data, Linear, Atlassian
- **Infrastructure Research**: AWS, Redis, Qdrant, Sentry

## Usage Scenarios
