# Information Access Framework: Unified Source Discovery System

## Overview

The Information Access Framework provides unified source discovery and coordination across 15+ technology mappings, enabling AI agents to optimally select and coordinate information sources for research, validation, and development tasks. This framework consolidates all source intelligence into a systematic, technology-aware coordination system.

## Core Architecture

### Unified Source Discovery Concept

- **Technology Mappings**: Specific mappings for React, TypeScript, Python, Database, AI/LLM coordination
- **Category Mappings**: Broader domain coverage for frontend, backend, infrastructure, testing
- **Source Selection Algorithm**: 3-step systematic process (topic analysis → mapping selection → source coordination)
- **MCP Integration**: Native integration with GitHub, Context7, knowledge-vault, and other MCP servers

```

## Source Selection Algorithm

### Step 1: Topic Analysis Implementation

```yaml
topic_analysis_process:
  technology_keyword_extraction:
    method: "Parse user request for specific technology terms"
    patterns:
      react_detection: ["react", "jsx", "hooks", "components"]
      typescript_detection: ["typescript", "ts", "type safety", "interfaces"]
      python_detection: ["python", "django", "flask", "fastapi"]
      database_detection: ["database", "sql", "postgresql", "mysql"]

  domain_classification:
    frontend_indicators: ["ui", "ux", "component", "frontend", "browser"]
    backend_indicators: ["api", "server", "backend", "database", "service"]
    infrastructure_indicators: ["deploy", "docker", "kubernetes", "ci", "cd"]

  complexity_assessment:
    simple: "Single technology, basic information needs"
    moderate: "Multiple related technologies, cross-domain analysis"
    complex: "Multiple domains, comprehensive research requirements"
```

### Step 2: Mapping Selection Logic

```yaml
mapping_selection_algorithm:
  priority_hierarchy:
    1_specific_technology:
      condition: "Detected technology in technology_mappings.keys()"
      action: "Use technology_mappings[detected_technology]"
      confidence: "high"

    2_category_match:
      condition: "Topic patterns match category_mappings"
      action: "Use best matching category_mappings"
      confidence: "medium"

    3_knowledge_vault_fallback:
      condition: "No specific or category match found"
      action: "Query knowledge-vault for available sources"
      confidence: "low"

  decision_validation:
    source_availability: "Verify MCP server availability and authentication"
    coverage_assessment: "Ensure minimum 3 source types per topic"
    quality_validation: "Cross-validate source reliability and freshness"
```

### Step 3: Source Coordination Patterns

```yaml
coordination_implementation:
  sequential_access:
    use_case: "Sources with dependencies or authentication requirements"
    pattern: "Primary sources → Supplementary sources → Validation sources"
    example: "MCP server authentication → GitHub search → Documentation validation"

  parallel_access:
    use_case: "Independent sources for comprehensive coverage"
    pattern: "Simultaneous access to GitHub, Context7, WebFetch"
    benefit: "Faster information gathering with diverse perspectives"

  conditional_access:
    use_case: "Sources activated based on intermediate findings"
    pattern: "Base research → conditional deep-dive sources"
    intelligence: "Adaptive source selection based on initial results"
```
