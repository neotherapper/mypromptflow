# Claude Sub-Agents: Comprehensive Best Practices

## Executive Summary

Claude Code sub-agents provide specialized AI assistants with independent 200k-token context windows, enabling parallel processing while preventing context pollution. This comprehensive guide consolidates best practices from extensive research analysis to ensure optimal sub-agent implementation within the constraints of the Claude Code architecture.

**Revolutionary Capability**: Sub-agents solve the fundamental "context pollution" problem by providing complete context isolation while enabling up to 10x performance improvements through parallel processing.

## Critical Architectural Constraints

### Fundamental Limitations (Non-Negotiable)
- **❌ Sub-agents CANNOT spawn other sub-agents** - This is a hard architectural constraint
- **❌ No nested sub-agent hierarchies** - Only main session can create sub-agents
- **❌ No direct sub-agent communication** - All coordination through main session
- **❌ No cross-sub-agent context sharing** - Each maintains independent 200k context

### Performance Boundaries
- **Maximum 10 concurrent sub-agents** - Additional tasks automatically queued
- **Linear token multiplication** - 3 parallel agents = ~3x token usage
- **200k context per agent** - Independent, isolated context windows
- **Main session orchestration required** - All coordination must go through primary Claude session

## Architecture Patterns

### Single Responsibility Principle (Critical)

**✅ RECOMMENDED PATTERN**:
```yaml
# Focused, specific expertise
---
name: "security-code-reviewer"
description: "Expert security code review specialist for identifying vulnerabilities, security anti-patterns, and compliance issues"
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch
priority: high
team: security
context_isolation: true
---
```

**❌ ANTI-PATTERN - Overly Broad Agents**:
```yaml
# Too general, unclear responsibilities
---
name: "full-stack-everything-agent"
description: "Handles all development tasks including frontend, backend, database, security, testing, and deployment"
tools: # All possible tools
---
```

### Optimal Granularity Framework

**✅ RECOMMENDED GRANULARITY**:
```bash
# Single comprehensive specialist per domain
.claude/agents/
├── react-specialist.md          # Complete React ecosystem expertise
├── security-auditor.md          # Comprehensive security analysis
├── performance-optimizer.md     # Full performance assessment
├── database-expert.md           # Complete database operations
├── information-access-specialist.md  # Unified source discovery
└── research-specialist.md       # 15-method research system
```

**❌ ANTI-PATTERN - Over-Specialization**:
```bash
# Too many micro-specialists requiring constant coordination
.claude/agents/
├── react-component-creator.md   # Too narrow scope
├── react-hook-optimizer.md      # Too narrow scope
├── react-state-manager.md       # Too narrow scope
├── react-performance-tuner.md   # Too narrow scope
└── react-testing-helper.md      # Too narrow scope
```

**Granularity Decision Framework**:
1. **Single Domain Focus**: Each agent covers one coherent problem domain
2. **Complete Capability**: Agent handles all aspects within its domain
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Obvious when to use this agent vs others
4. **Context Completeness**: Can be effectively described in 200k context window
5. **Framework Integration**: Can leverage existing frameworks (information-access, research, etc.)

## Configuration Standards

### YAML Frontmatter Requirements

**Essential Fields**:
```yaml
---
name: "unique-agent-identifier"              # Required: Unique, descriptive
description: "Clear purpose and usage criteria"  # Required: When to invoke
tools: Read, Grep, Glob                     # Optional: Minimal necessary set
priority: high                              # Optional: high/medium/low
team: backend                               # Optional: Team assignment
environment: production                     # Optional: Environment-specific
context_isolation: true                     # Recommended: Explicit isolation
---
```

**Enhanced Configuration Fields**:
```yaml
---
name: "information-access-specialist"
description: "Expert in unified source discovery and information access coordination using the meta framework's source intelligence system"
tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, Grep, Glob, Read, mcp__MCP_DOCKER__search_repositories, mcp__MCP_DOCKER__get-library-docs
priority: high
team: research
context_isolation: true
framework_integration: "information-access"  # Links to framework documentation
specialization_domain: "source_discovery"   # Clear expertise domain
quality_standards: "constitutional_ai"      # Quality validation requirements
---
```

### Tool Selection Best Practices

**Minimal Necessary Tools Principle**:
```yaml
# ✅ Good: Only essential tools for domain
tools: Read, Grep, Glob

# ❌ Avoid: Kitchen sink approach
tools: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch, TodoWrite
```

**Domain-Specific Tool Guidelines**:
```yaml
tool_assignment_patterns:
  research_agents: "WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Grep, Glob"
  code_analysis: "Read, Grep, Glob, Bash (for execution)"
  documentation: "Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit"
  validation: "Read, Grep, Glob (read-only for safety)"
  coordination: "TodoWrite, Edit, MultiEdit (management tools)"
  information_access: "WebSearch, WebFetch, MCP tools for source discovery"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Context Isolation Validation

**Context Independence Requirements**:
```yaml
context_isolation_checklist:
  independent_context_window: "Each agent operates in isolated 200k-token space"
  no_context_sharing: "Agents cannot access each other's conversations"
  clean_result_delivery: "Results summarized without implementation details"
  pollution_prevention: "Main conversation preserved from sub-agent work"
  framework_integration: "Agents can leverage frameworks within their context"
```

**Validation Patterns**:
```yaml
# ✅ Good: Context isolation preserved
Main Context: Architecture discussion
├── Sub-Agent: Security review (isolated + framework access)
├── Sub-Agent: Performance analysis (isolated + optimization framework)
└── Results: Clean summaries returned to main context

# ❌ Avoid: Context bleeding
Main Context: Architecture + security details + performance logs + implementation specifics
```

### Token Management Strategy

**Performance Planning**:
```yaml
token_usage_optimization:
  single_agent: "Standard token consumption"
  parallel_3_agents: "~3x token usage, 3x faster completion"
  parallel_5_agents: "~5x token usage, 5x faster completion"
  parallel_10_agents: "~10x token usage, 10x faster completion"
  
  cost_benefit_analysis:
    benefit: "Dramatically faster completion, context isolation"
    cost: "Linear token multiplication"
    optimization: "Use parallel processing for independent tasks"
    fallback: "Sequential execution for dependent workflows"
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Framework-Enhanced Sub-Agents

**Information Access Integration**:
```yaml
# Example: React specialist with framework integration
---
name: "react-specialist"
description: "Comprehensive React development specialist leveraging unified source discovery framework"
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch, mcp__MCP_DOCKER__search_repositories
framework_integration: "information-access"
---

# Agent automatically leverages:
# - React-specific source mappings from information-access framework
# - GitHub repository coordination
# - Context7 documentation access
# - Knowledge-vault React expertise
```

**Research Integration**:
```yaml
# Research specialist already integrates 15-method orchestrator
research_integration:
  framework: "research-orchestrator"
  capabilities: "15 research methods with intelligent selection"
  quality_validation: "Constitutional AI principles"
  context_isolation: "Independent 200k context for research"
  output_standards: "Enhanced file structure compliance"
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

**Sequential Processing (Dependent Tasks)**:
```yaml
development_workflow:
  phase_1: "requirements-analyst → Business requirements analysis"
  phase_2: "system-architect → Technical architecture design"
  phase_3: "implementation-lead → Development coordination"
  phase_4: "qa-specialist → Testing and quality assurance"
  
  coordination: "Main session orchestrates sequence"
  context_preservation: "Each phase maintains independent context"
```

**Parallel Processing (Independent Tasks)**:
```yaml
comprehensive_analysis:
  parallel_specialists:
    react_specialist: "Frontend implementation analysis"
    security_auditor: "Security vulnerability assessment"
    performance_optimizer: "Performance bottleneck identification"
    database_expert: "Database design optimization"
  
  coordination: "Main session orchestrates parallel execution"
  results_integration: "Clean consolidation without context pollution"
```

**Adaptive Specialist Selection**:
```yaml
intelligent_routing:
  file_type_routing:
    "*.tsx, *.jsx": "react-specialist"
    "*.py, *.sql": "backend-specialist"
    "*.yml, *.yaml": "infrastructure-expert"
    "security-sensitive": "security-auditor"
  
  complexity_routing:
    simple_tasks: "single appropriate specialist"
    moderate_tasks: "2-3 coordinated specialists"
    complex_tasks: "5-10 parallel specialists with integration"
```

```

## Creation and Management Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
```yaml
agent_planning:
  domain_identification: "What specific problem domain needs expertise?"
  boundary_definition: "What are the clear limits of this agent's responsibility?"
  framework_integration: "Which frameworks will this agent leverage?"
  tool_requirements: "What minimal tools are needed for domain expertise?"
  quality_standards: "What constitutional AI requirements apply?"
```

### Phase 2: Claude-Generated Foundation
```yaml
generation_approach:
  prompt_pattern: "Create a sub-agent for [specific domain] that leverages [relevant frameworks] with [clear boundaries]"
  quality_requirements: "Include proper YAML frontmatter, focused system prompt, framework integration"
  best_practice_compliance: "Ensure single responsibility and context isolation"
  
  example_prompt: "Generate a database performance sub-agent that leverages the information-access framework for source discovery and maintains context isolation"
```

```

## Anti-Patterns and Common Mistakes

### Critical Architecture Violations

**❌ Attempting Sub-Agent Spawning**:
```yaml
# NEVER attempt this - will fail
sub_agent_task: "Create another sub-agent to handle database queries"
# Correct approach: Main session creates database-expert sub-agent
```

**❌ Cross-Sub-Agent Communication**:
```yaml
# NEVER attempt this - contexts are isolated
sub_agent_coordination: "Communicate with security-auditor about findings"
# Correct approach: Both agents report to main session for coordination
```

**❌ Context Pollution**:
```yaml
# Avoid returning implementation details to main session
bad_response: "After analyzing 500 lines of code, examining 15 functions, checking 8 security patterns..."
# Better: Clean summary
good_response: "Security review complete. Found 2 high-priority issues with specific recommendations."
```

### Configuration Anti-Patterns

**❌ Overlapping Responsibilities**:
```yaml
# Avoid multiple agents with unclear boundaries
agents:
  - name: "code-reviewer"          # Too broad, overlaps with others
  - name: "quality-checker"        # Overlaps with code-reviewer
  - name: "security-reviewer"      # Overlaps with code-reviewer
  
# Better: Clear domain separation
agents:
  - name: "ai-instruction-validator"     # Focused: AI instruction validation
  - name: "framework-compliance-validator"  # Focused: Framework compliance
  - name: "security-code-reviewer"       # Focused: Security-specific code review
```

**❌ Insufficient Framework Integration**:
```yaml
# Missing framework leverage
name: "research-agent"
# Missing framework integration information

# Better: Explicit framework integration
name: "research-specialist"
description: "Specialized agent for comprehensive research using the 15-method orchestrator system"
framework_integration: "research-orchestrator"
```
