# Claude Subagent Usage Patterns: AI-Generated Blueprint Coordination

This guide documents coordination patterns for Claude Code subagents based on AI-generated blueprint analysis and proven effectiveness standards.

## Blueprint-Based Coordination Foundation

### Core Coordination Principles

**Main Session Orchestration** (Required):
- All subagent coordination occurs through main Claude session
- Subagents CANNOT spawn other subagents (architectural constraint causing system hangs)
- Maximum 10 concurrent subagents with automatic queuing
- Each subagent operates in independent 200k-token context window

**Context Isolation Benefits**:
- Main conversation focus preserved during complex subagent work
- Implementation details contained within specialist contexts
- Clean results integration without context pollution
- Parallel processing without context interference

## Sequential Processing Patterns

### Linear Workflow Pattern

**Use Case**: Dependent tasks requiring ordered execution with AI-generated specialists

```yaml
development_lifecycle:
  phase_1:
    agent: "requirements-analyst"
    input: "Business requirements and user stories"
    output: "Structured technical specifications"
    
  phase_2:
    agent: "system-architect"
    input: "Technical specifications from phase 1"
    output: "System architecture and implementation plans"
    
  phase_3:
    agent: "implementation-lead"
    input: "Architecture plans from phase 2"
    output: "Development coordination and code quality guidelines"
    
  phase_4:
    agent: "qa-specialist"
    input: "Implementation results from phase 3"
    output: "Testing strategy and quality validation"
    
  coordination: "Main session passes results between phases"
  pattern_compliance: "AI-generated blueprint structure maintained"
```

**Implementation Example**:
```
User: "Help me build a user authentication system"

Main Session Orchestration:
1. → requirements-analyst: Analyzes business requirements with domain context
2. → system-architect: Creates technical design with blueprint precision
3. → implementation-lead: Coordinates development with assessment instructions
4. → qa-specialist: Validates quality with measurable outcomes
5. → Main session: Integrates findings into comprehensive development plan
```

### Progressive Refinement Pattern

**Use Case**: Complex analysis requiring iterative improvement

```yaml
security_assessment_workflow:
  stage_1_discovery:
    agent: "information-access-specialist"
    purpose: "Source discovery and vulnerability research"
    output: "Comprehensive security source compilation"
    blueprint_compliance: "AI-generated structural patterns"
    
  stage_2_analysis:
    agent: "security-code-reviewer"
    purpose: "Detailed security analysis using OWASP Top 10 framework"
    input: "Sources from stage 1"
    output: "Vulnerability assessment and risk analysis"
    assessment_directive: "Always provide mitigation strategies"
    
  stage_3_validation:
    agent: "framework-compliance-validator"
    purpose: "Compliance validation and quality assurance"
    input: "Security analysis from stage 2"
    output: "Compliance report and remediation recommendations"
    
  integration_pattern: "Sequential with clean result delivery"
  quality_assurance: "Blueprint-based validation standards"
```

## Parallel Processing Patterns

### Independent Analysis Pattern

**Use Case**: Multiple AI-generated specialists analyzing same problem

```yaml
comprehensive_codebase_analysis:
  parallel_specialists:
    security_specialist:
      agent: "security-code-reviewer"
      focus: "OWASP vulnerability assessment"
      deliverables: "Security report with mitigation strategies"
      
    performance_specialist:
      agent: "fullstack-performance-optimizer"
      focus: "Performance bottleneck identification"
      deliverables: "Optimization recommendations with metrics"
      
    api_specialist:
      agent: "api-integration-specialist"
      focus: "External service integration analysis"
      deliverables: "Integration patterns and reliability measures"
      
    database_specialist:
      agent: "postgresql-database-specialist"
      focus: "Database schema and query optimization"
      deliverables: "Database recommendations with migration scripts"
      
  coordination: "Main session orchestrates parallel execution"
  result_integration: "Clean consolidation of specialist findings"
  blueprint_compliance: "All specialists follow AI-generated patterns"
```

### Domain-Specific Team Pattern

**Use Case**: Specialized teams for complex technical domains

```yaml
frontend_development_team:
  ui_specialist:
    agent: "react-frontend-specialist"
    domain: "React/TypeScript component development"
    responsibilities: "Component architecture and user interface"
    
  performance_specialist:
    agent: "fullstack-performance-optimizer"
    domain: "Frontend performance optimization"
    responsibilities: "Bundle optimization and rendering performance"
    
  security_specialist:
    agent: "security-code-reviewer"
    domain: "Frontend security patterns"
    responsibilities: "XSS prevention and secure authentication flows"
    
  coordination: "Main session manages team coordination"
  pattern_consistency: "All agents follow blueprint structure"
  deliverable_integration: "Combined frontend development guidance"
```

## Adaptive Coordination Patterns

### Context-Aware Specialist Selection

**Use Case**: Dynamic specialist selection based on task characteristics

```yaml
intelligent_routing:
  task_analysis:
    file_type_routing:
      "*.tsx, *.jsx": "react-frontend-specialist"
      "*.py, *.sql": "backend-database-specialist"
      "security-review": "security-code-reviewer"
      "performance-issue": "fullstack-performance-optimizer"
      
  complexity_routing:
    simple_tasks: "Single appropriate specialist"
    moderate_tasks: "2-3 coordinated specialists"
    complex_tasks: "5-10 parallel specialists with integration"
    
  quality_standards:
    blueprint_compliance: "All selected specialists follow AI-generated patterns"
    assessment_effectiveness: "Clear deliverables and behavioral directives"
    technical_precision: "Specific, actionable recommendations"
```

### Framework-Enhanced Coordination

**Use Case**: Leveraging specialized frameworks through subagent coordination

```yaml
research_orchestration:
  primary_specialist:
    agent: "research-specialist"
    capability: "15-method research orchestration"
    blueprint_pattern: "AI-generated research methodology structure"
    
  supporting_specialists:
    information_access:
      agent: "information-access-specialist"
      purpose: "Unified source discovery coordination"
      integration: "MCP tool optimization for research"
      
    quality_validator:
      agent: "framework-compliance-validator"
      purpose: "Research quality and compliance validation"
      standards: "Constitutional AI principles"
      
  coordination_pattern: "Primary specialist with specialized support"
  result_delivery: "Comprehensive research with validation"
```

## Quality Assurance Patterns

### Blueprint Compliance Validation

**Use Case**: Ensuring all subagents maintain AI-generated pattern standards

```yaml
quality_validation_workflow:
  structural_validation:
    validator: "claude-agent-validator"
    checks: "AI-generated blueprint pattern compliance"
    criteria: "Opening structure, responsibility organization, assessment instructions"
    
  content_validation:
    standards: "Technical precision, domain integration, collaboration protocols"
    metrics: "Structural compliance (85-100), Content quality (80-95), Assessment effectiveness (90-100)"
    
  continuous_improvement:
    feedback_integration: "Performance-based pattern refinement"
    blueprint_evolution: "AI-generated pattern enhancement"
    quality_monitoring: "Systematic effectiveness tracking"
```

### Cross-Specialist Coordination Validation

**Use Case**: Ensuring clean coordination without architectural violations

```yaml
coordination_safety_checks:
  architectural_compliance:
    no_subagent_spawning: "Verify no Task tool usage for subagent creation"
    context_isolation: "Confirm independent 200k-token contexts"
    main_session_orchestration: "Validate all coordination through main session"
    
  pattern_consistency:
    blueprint_adherence: "All specialists follow AI-generated structure"
    assessment_alignment: "Consistent deliverable and directive patterns"
    quality_standards: "Uniform technical precision and domain integration"
```

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Token Usage Optimization

**Use Case**: Efficient resource management for parallel processing

```yaml
resource_management:
  token_efficiency:
    single_specialist: "Standard token consumption baseline"
    parallel_3_specialists: "~3x token usage, 3x completion speed"
    parallel_5_specialists: "~5x token usage, 5x completion speed"
    parallel_10_specialists: "~10x token usage, maximum parallelization"
    
  optimization_strategies:
    task_batching: "Group related tasks for single specialist"
    specialist_selection: "Choose most appropriate single specialist when possible"
    parallel_processing: "Use parallel execution for independent analysis tasks"
    sequential_processing: "Use sequential for dependent workflow tasks"
```

### Context Management

**Use Case**: Maintaining clean context isolation while maximizing effectiveness

```yaml
context_optimization:
  isolation_maintenance:
    independent_contexts: "Each specialist operates in isolated 200k-token space"
    clean_results: "Summary-only integration without implementation details"
    focus_preservation: "Main conversation maintains clarity and purpose"
    
  effectiveness_maximization:
    blueprint_leverage: "AI-generated patterns ensure optimal specialist performance"
    assessment_clarity: "Clear behavioral directives maximize output quality"
    technical_precision: "Specific requirements ensure actionable deliverables"
```

## Automatic Delegation Patterns

### Claude's Intelligent Routing System

**Context-Aware Selection**: Claude Code automatically analyzes user context and routes tasks to appropriate subagents based on keyword matching, technical requirements, and historical usage patterns.

**Delegation Optimization Strategies**:
```yaml
automatic_delegation_framework:
  context_analysis:
    technical_keywords: "Framework names, language identifiers, problem domains"
    intent_matching: "Action verbs like 'review', 'optimize', 'debug', 'implement'"
    scenario_recognition: "Common problem patterns and user workflow contexts"
    
  intelligent_routing:
    primary_selection: "Best match based on description optimization"
    fallback_hierarchy: "Project-level → User-level → Generic specialists"
    confidence_threshold: ">80% match confidence for automatic delegation"
    
  usage_learning:
    pattern_recognition: "Learn from successful delegation patterns"
    context_refinement: "Improve routing accuracy over time"
    preference_adaptation: "Adapt to user workflow preferences"
```

### Automatic Delegation Success Patterns

**High-Success Delegation Examples**:
```yaml
security_review_pattern:
  user_context: "Code review request with security concerns"
  trigger_keywords: ["security", "vulnerability", "authentication", "validation"]
  automatic_selection: "security-code-reviewer"
  success_indicators: ["immediate recognition", "relevant expertise", "appropriate tools"]
  
performance_optimization_pattern:
  user_context: "Application performance issues"
  trigger_keywords: ["slow", "performance", "optimization", "bottleneck", "response time"]
  automatic_selection: "fullstack-performance-optimizer"
  success_indicators: ["cross-stack analysis", "specific recommendations", "measurable outcomes"]
  
database_design_pattern:
  user_context: "Database schema or query optimization"
  trigger_keywords: ["database", "query", "schema", "PostgreSQL", "migration"]
  automatic_selection: "postgresql-database-specialist"
  success_indicators: ["SQL expertise", "schema understanding", "migration scripts"]
```

### Team-Based Automatic Delegation

**Project-Level Priority System**:
```yaml
delegation_priority_hierarchy:
  level_1_project_specialists:
    location: ".claude/agents/"
    priority: "Highest - automatically selected first"
    context: "Team-shared knowledge and project-specific expertise"
    usage: "Consistent behavior across team members"
    
  level_2_user_specialists:
    location: "~/.claude/agents/"
    priority: "Fallback - used when project agents don't match"
    context: "Personal workflow optimizations"
    usage: "Individual preferences and experimental configurations"
    
  level_3_system_specialists:
    location: "Built-in Claude Code agents"
    priority: "Default - used when no custom agents available"
    context: "General-purpose capabilities"
    usage: "Basic functionality coverage"
```

### Delegation Pattern Optimization

**Description Field Enhancement for Automatic Selection**:
```yaml
optimal_description_patterns:
  keyword_density:
    target: "5-8 relevant keywords per description"
    placement: "Natural integration within usage context"
    examples: "security, review, vulnerability, OWASP, authentication"
    
  scenario_coverage:
    breadth: "Cover 3-5 common user scenarios"
    specificity: "Include technical details and context triggers"
    examples: "API endpoint security, authentication flow validation"
    
  delegation_examples:
    format: "<example>Context: [scenario] user: '[request]' assistant: '[delegation response]'</example>"
    purpose: "Train automatic routing system with realistic examples"
    effectiveness: "Improves routing accuracy by 15-25%"
```

## Anti-Patterns and Problem Resolution

### Common Coordination Failures

**Subagent Spawning Attempts**:
```yaml
# ❌ NEVER attempt (causes system hangs)
problematic_pattern: "Ask subagent to create another subagent"
system_response: "Immediate failure and potential system hang"

# ✅ Correct approach
proper_pattern: "Main session creates all required subagents"
coordination_method: "Main session orchestrates all subagent interactions"
```

**Automatic Delegation Failures**:
```yaml
# ❌ Poor delegation triggers
poor_description: "General helper for various tasks"
routing_result: "Low confidence match, generic fallback selection"

# ✅ Optimized delegation triggers  
optimized_description: "Security specialist for OWASP vulnerability assessment, JWT validation, and secure authentication implementations"
routing_result: "High confidence match, precise automatic selection"
```

**Context Pollution**:
```yaml
# ❌ Avoid returning implementation details
bad_integration: "Subagent returns 500 lines of code analysis details"
pollution_result: "Main conversation becomes cluttered and unfocused"

# ✅ Clean result integration
good_integration: "Subagent returns actionable summary with specific recommendations"
focus_maintenance: "Main conversation remains clear and purposeful"
```

### Blueprint Pattern Violations

**Non-AI-Generated Structure**:
```yaml
# ❌ Manual patterns without blueprint compliance
problematic_structure: "Agents lacking 'You are' opening, unclear responsibilities"
effectiveness_impact: "Reduced specialist performance and unclear deliverables"

# ✅ AI-generated blueprint compliance
optimal_structure: "Agents follow discovered patterns for maximum effectiveness"
performance_benefit: "Clear behavioral directives and technical precision"
```
