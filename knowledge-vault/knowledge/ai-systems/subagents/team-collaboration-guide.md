# Claude Code Subagents: Team Collaboration Guide

Comprehensive framework for professional team collaboration using Claude Code subagents, including storage strategies, version control integration, workflow optimization, and enterprise collaboration patterns.

## 1. Team Subagent Storage Strategies

### Storage Hierarchy and Team Organization

#### Project-Level Storage (.claude/agents/)

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Project-specific subagents with specialized domain knowledge
- Team-shared configurations for consistent project workflows
- Version-controlled collaboration tools requiring team synchronization
- Domain specialists (e.g., frontend, backend, database, testing)

**Best Practices:**
```yaml
project_storage_strategy:
  structure:
    .claude/agents/
      ├── domain-specialists/       # Core technical domains
      │   ├── frontend-specialist.md
      │   ├── backend-specialist.md
      │   └── database-specialist.md
      ├── workflow-coordinators/     # Team process management
      │   ├── task-coordinator.md
      │   ├── code-reviewer.md
      │   └── deployment-coordinator.md
      └── project-specific/          # Project-unique requirements
          ├── business-logic-specialist.md
          └── integration-specialist.md

  naming_conventions:
    format: "[role]-[specialization].md"
    examples:
      - "frontend-react-specialist.md"
      - "backend-api-coordinator.md"
      - "testing-automation-specialist.md"
      - "deployment-infrastructure-manager.md"

  team_coordination:
    shared_agents: ["task-coordinator", "code-reviewer", "project-manager"]
    domain_agents: ["frontend-specialist", "backend-specialist", "database-specialist"]
    workflow_agents: ["deployment-coordinator", "quality-assurance-specialist"]
```

#### Personal Storage (~/.claude/agents/)

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Individual developer preferences and personal productivity tools
- Cross-project utilities and personal workflow optimization
- Experimental agents under development
- Personal learning and skill development assistants

**Best Practices:**
```yaml

  categories:
    productivity:
      - "personal-task-manager.md"
      - "code-optimization-assistant.md"
      - "learning-coordinator.md"
    
    development_tools:
      - "debugging-specialist.md"
      - "performance-analyzer.md"
      - "documentation-assistant.md"
    
    experimentation:
      - "experimental-feature-explorer.md"
      - "technology-research-assistant.md"
      - "prototype-coordinator.md"

## 2. Version Control Integration and Git Workflows

### Git Integration Strategies

#### Subagent Version Control Best Practices

```yaml
git_workflow_integration:
  branching_strategy:
    agent_development:
      - Create feature branches for new agents: "feat/add-testing-specialist"
      - Use dedicated branches for agent updates: "update/frontend-specialist-v2"
      - Maintain agent-specific branches for major revisions
    
    collaborative_development:
      - Team reviews for new shared agents
      - Pull request templates for agent changes
      - Automated testing for agent configuration validity

  commit_conventions:
    new_agents: "feat(agents): add [role] specialist for [domain]"
    updates: "update(agents): enhance [agent-name] with [capability]"
    fixes: "fix(agents): resolve [issue] in [agent-name]"
    removals: "remove(agents): deprecate [agent-name] - replaced by [new-agent]"

  review_process:
    mandatory_reviews:
      - New shared agents require 2+ team member approval
