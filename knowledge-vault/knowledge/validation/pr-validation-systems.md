# PR Validation Systems - AI Agent Knowledge

## Multi-Role Validation Framework

Apply role-aware validation patterns using specialized agent coordination for comprehensive pull request analysis.

### Core Validation Architecture

**Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern**:
```yaml
validation_coordination:
  primary_roles:
    - architect: "System design and architectural assessment"
    - frontend-dev: "User experience and implementation quality"
    - performance: "Runtime efficiency and optimization analysis"
    - security: "Vulnerability detection and security compliance"
    
  coordination_pattern:
    parallel_execution: true
    dependency_management: "security-first, then parallel role analysis"
    result_aggregation: "consensus-based decision with role-specific weights"
```

**Role-Specific Analysis Patterns**:

#### Architect Analysis Focus
- System design patterns and architectural compliance
- Code organization and component structure
- Integration patterns and dependency management
- Scalability and maintainability assessment

### File Type Detection and Agent Mapping

**Conditional Detection Architecture**:
```yaml
detection_layers:
  extension_patterns:
    typescript_react: ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]
    javascript_react: ["*.js", "*.jsx"] 
    python_backend: ["*.py"]
    configuration: ["*.yaml", "*.json", "*.md"]
    
  content_analysis:
    react_indicators: ["import React", "JSX.Element", "useState", "useEffect"]
    backend_indicators: ["from flask import", "def api_", "@app.route"]
    config_indicators: ["apiVersion:", "services:", "image:"]
    
  context_clues:
    project_structure: ["src/", "components/", "api/", "tests/"]
    dependencies: ["package.json", "requirements.txt", "docker-compose.yml"]
```

**Agent Spawning Logic**:
```yaml
spawning_conditions:
  react_frontend:
    file_patterns: ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"]
    required_agents: ["architect", "frontend-dev", "performance", "security"]
    context_loading: "REQUEST_CONTEXT(react-frontend-dev, react-performance)"
    
  python_backend:
    file_patterns: ["**/*.py", "api/**/*"]
    required_agents: ["architect", "security", "performance"]
    context_loading: "REQUEST_CONTEXT(backend-security, api-architecture)"
    
  configuration_files:
    file_patterns: ["*.{yaml,json}", "docker-compose.yml", ".github/workflows/*"]
    required_agents: ["security", "architect"]
    context_loading: "REQUEST_CONTEXT(devops-security, infrastructure-security)"
```

### Intent-Implementation Validation

**Semantic Alignment Assessment**:
```yaml
intent_validation:
  dimensions:
    stated_purpose_match: 
      weight: 30%
      criteria: "PR description alignment with actual implementation"
      
    scope_consistency:
      weight: 25% 
      criteria: "Changes remain within declared scope boundaries"
      
    implementation_completeness:
      weight: 25%
      criteria: "Stated functionality is fully implemented"
      
    undisclosed_changes:
      weight: 20%
      criteria: "No significant undisclosed modifications"
      
  scoring_thresholds:
    approved: "≥85% semantic alignment"
    conditional: "70-84% alignment"
    needs_work: "50-69% alignment"
    critical: "<50% alignment"
```

**Scope Creep Detection Patterns**:
```yaml
scope_analysis:
  primary_changes: "Direct implementation of stated functionality"
  secondary_changes: "Supporting modifications within reasonable scope"
  scope_creep_indicators:
    - "Unrelated feature additions"
    - "Unnecessary refactoring beyond stated goals"
    - "Changes to unrelated business logic"
    - "New functionality not mentioned in PR description"
```

### Validation Quality Standards

**Constitutional AI Compliance**:
```yaml
constitutional_principles:
  accuracy: "Validation must accurately assess code quality and risks"
  completeness: "All critical aspects must be evaluated comprehensively"
  consistency: "Similar code patterns receive consistent assessment"
  transparency: "Validation reasoning must be explainable and auditable"
  
compliance_requirements:
  principle_adherence: "Framework designed for ≥99% compliance across all validation operations"
  bias_detection: "Systematic identification and mitigation of assessment biases"
  fairness_assessment: "Equitable evaluation across different coding styles"
  harm_prevention: "Proactive identification of potential security or stability risks"
```

**Multi-Role Quality Metrics**:
```yaml
effectiveness_targets:
  role_accuracy:
    architect: "≥95% architectural assessment accuracy"
    frontend_dev: "≥95% UX and implementation accuracy"
    performance: "≥92% performance analysis accuracy"
    security: "≥98% security vulnerability detection"
    
  cross_role_metrics:
    consensus_rate: "≥85% agreement on issue severity"
    coordination_efficiency: "≥90% successful multi-role coordination"
    false_positive_rate: "<5% across all validation types"
    false_negative_rate: "<3% for critical issues"
```

### Role-Aware Context Loading

**REQUEST_CONTEXT() Patterns**:
```yaml
context_loading_strategies:
  role_specific_knowledge:
    architect: "REQUEST_CONTEXT(typescript-architect, react-architect)"
    frontend_dev: "REQUEST_CONTEXT(react-frontend-dev, typescript-frontend-dev)"
    performance: "REQUEST_CONTEXT(react-performance, typescript-performance)"
    security: "REQUEST_CONTEXT(react-security, testing-security)"
    
  technology_adaptive:
    typescript_projects: "Load TypeScript-specific architectural patterns"
    react_components: "Load React best practices and performance patterns"
    api_endpoints: "Load backend security and architecture contexts"
    configuration: "Load DevOps security and infrastructure contexts"
```

**Knowledge Source Integration**:
```yaml
knowledge_sources:
  technology_contexts:
    - "@knowledge-vault/knowledge/technologies/react/react-frontend-dev.md"
    - "@knowledge-vault/knowledge/technologies/typescript/typescript-architect.md"
    - "@knowledge-vault/knowledge/technologies/testing/testing-security.md"
    
  validation_templates:
    - "@knowledge-vault/knowledge/templates/validation-templates.md"

```

### Actionable Recommendation Generation

**Priority-Based Recommendation Matrix**:
```yaml
recommendation_framework:
  critical_issues:
    response_time: "≤2 hours"
    criteria: "Security vulnerabilities, breaking changes, production risks"
    required_actions: ["Stop deployment", "Fix immediately", "Security review"]
    
  high_priority:
    response_time: "≤24 hours" 
    criteria: "Major functionality issues, significant performance problems"
    recommended_actions: ["Priority fix", "Performance optimization", "Code review"]
    
  medium_priority:
    response_time: "≤72 hours"
    criteria: "Code quality issues, minor performance concerns"
    suggested_actions: ["Refactoring", "Optimization", "Documentation"]
    
  low_priority:
    response_time: "≤1 week"
    criteria: "Code style, documentation improvements"
    improvement_actions: ["Style fixes", "Documentation updates", "Minor optimizations"]
```

**Role-Specific Recommendation Templates**:
```yaml
recommendation_templates:
  architect_recommendations:
    focus: "System design, scalability, maintainability"
    template: "Architectural impact analysis with solution alternatives"
    
  frontend_recommendations:
    focus: "User experience, accessibility, browser compatibility"

    - "Execute role-specific validation in parallel"
    - "Monitor progress and handle agent coordination"
    
  result_aggregation:
    - "Collect role-specific validation results"
    - "Apply consensus-based decision making"
    - "Generate priority-based recommendations"
    - "Produce comprehensive validation report"
```

**Quality Assurance Integration**:
```yaml
quality_validation:
  pre_execution:
    - "Validate agent context loading success"
    - "Verify role assignment correctness"
    - "Check validation template availability"
    
  during_execution:
    - "Monitor agent performance and accuracy"
    - "Validate role-specific result quality"
    - "Ensure constitutional AI compliance"
    
  post_execution:
    - "Validate result consistency across roles"
    - "Verify recommendation priority accuracy"
    - "Check overall validation completeness"
```
