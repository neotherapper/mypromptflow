### Intent Parsing and Analysis

**Intent Classification Patterns**:
```yaml
intent_categories:
  feature_addition:
    indicators: ["add", "implement", "create", "build", "introduce"]
    expectations:
      - "New functionality implemented with tests"
      - "Documentation updated to reflect changes"
      - "Integration with existing features validated"
      - "User experience considerations addressed"
      
  bug_fix:
    indicators: ["fix", "resolve", "correct", "patch", "repair"]
    expectations:
      - "Specific issue addressed with minimal scope"
      - "Root cause elimination demonstrated"
      - "Regression tests added or updated"
      - "Related code review for similar issues"
      
  refactoring:
    indicators: ["refactor", "restructure", "reorganize", "optimize"]
    expectations:
      - "No functional changes introduced"
      - "Code structure and quality improved"
      - "Test coverage maintained or enhanced"

      - "Impact assessment provided"
      - "User benefit articulation"
```

**Content Analysis Framework**:
```yaml
intent_extraction:
  pr_title_analysis:
    patterns:
      - "Extract action verbs and target components"
      - "Identify scope indicators and constraints"
      - "Parse technical terminology and context"

      - "Testing coverage and quality"
      - "Documentation completeness"
      - "Security and performance considerations"
```

### Implementation Analysis Patterns

**Change Assessment Framework**:
```yaml
implementation_analysis:
  file_change_categorization:
    primary_changes:
      definition: "Direct implementation of stated functionality"
      examples:
        - "New component creation for stated feature"
        - "Bug fix in specific identified location"
        - "API endpoint implementation for described functionality"
        
    secondary_changes:
      definition: "Supporting modifications within reasonable scope"
      examples:
        - "Type definitions for new functionality"
        - "Test files for implemented features"
        - "Documentation updates for changes"
        - "Configuration adjustments for feature support"
        
    scope_creep_changes:
      definition: "Modifications beyond stated intent"
      examples:
        - "Unrelated feature additions or modifications"
        - "Refactoring unrelated to stated goals"
        - "Performance optimizations not mentioned"
        - "Dependency updates not justified in context"
```

**Technical Implementation Validation**:
```yaml
implementation_validation:
  functional_completeness:
    assessment_criteria:
      - "All stated functionality implemented"
      - "Edge cases and error conditions handled"
      - "Integration points properly implemented"
      - "User experience flows complete"
      
  quality_completeness:
    assessment_criteria:
      - "Testing coverage for new functionality"
      - "Documentation updates for changes"
      - "Accessibility considerations addressed"
      - "Security implications evaluated"
      
  technical_soundness:
    assessment_criteria:
      - "Implementation follows established patterns"
      - "Code quality meets project standards"
      - "Performance impact acceptable"
      - "Maintainability considerations addressed"
```

### Scope Creep Detection

**Scope Boundary Analysis**:
```yaml
scope_validation:
  boundary_definition:
    explicit_scope:
      - "Directly stated functionality in PR description"
      - "Specific components or areas mentioned"
      - "Clear problem definition and solution approach"
      
    implicit_scope:
      - "Reasonable supporting changes for implementation"
      - "Necessary refactoring for clean implementation"
      - "Required updates for consistency"
      
    scope_violations:
      - "Unrelated functionality additions"
      - "Unnecessary optimization or refactoring"
      - "Changes to unrelated business logic"
      - "Infrastructure modifications without justification"
      
  change_categorization:
    acceptable_expansion:
      criteria: "Changes that support main intent without significant expansion"
      examples:
        - "Type safety improvements for new feature"
        - "Minor refactoring required for clean implementation"
        - "Related bug fixes discovered during implementation"
        
    questionable_expansion:
      criteria: "Changes that extend beyond core intent but may be justified"
      examples:
        - "Performance optimizations not mentioned"
        - "Related feature improvements"
        - "Code style standardization across touched files"
        
    clear_scope_creep:
      criteria: "Changes that clearly exceed stated intent"
      examples:
        - "New features unrelated to PR description"
        - "Major refactoring of unrelated code"
        - "Business logic changes not mentioned"
        - "UI/UX changes not described"
```

### Alignment Scoring System

**Scoring Algorithm Framework**:

        implementation_completeness * 0.25 +
        undisclosed_changes * 0.20
      )
      
  scoring_thresholds:
    approved: "â‰¥85% - Strong alignment, minimal issues"
    conditional: "70-84% - Good alignment with minor concerns"
    needs_work: "50-69% - Significant alignment issues"
    critical: "<50% - Major disconnect requiring revision"
    
  dimension_scoring:
    excellent: "90-100% - Exceptional alignment"
    good: "80-89% - Strong alignment with minor gaps"
    fair: "70-79% - Adequate alignment with some concerns"
