- **Automation Strategy**: Balance automation investment with maintenance overhead

### 3. Quality Assurance

- **Metrics and Monitoring**: Establish meaningful quality metrics and monitoring
- **Continuous Improvement**: Implement feedback loops and process optimization
- **Team Development**: Invest in team skills and testing culture
- **Compliance and Standards**: Ensure testing meets regulatory and industry standards
- **Innovation Balance**: Balance proven practices with emerging testing techniques

## Context Usage Guidelines

**For AI Agents in Architect Role:**
1. Focus on high-level testing strategy and system design decisions

4. Think in terms of system boundaries, quality gates, and process integration
5. Consider both current testing best practices and emerging trends

**Don't Include:**
- Detailed test implementation code (use testing specialist context)
- Specific tool configuration details (use implementation contexts)
- Basic testing concepts (use fundamental learning contexts)
- Language-specific testing patterns (use technology-specific contexts)

This context should guide architectural thinking and high-level strategic decisions for testing systems and processes.
