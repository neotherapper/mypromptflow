## Security Testing Best Practices

### 1. Risk-Based Security Testing

- **Threat Model Integration**: Base testing priorities on identified threats and attack vectors
- **Asset Criticality Assessment**: Focus testing efforts on high-value assets and critical functions
- **Attack Surface Analysis**: Systematically identify and test all potential attack vectors
- **Business Impact Consideration**: Align security testing with business risk tolerance and impact

### 2. Shift-Left Security Integration

- **Early Security Validation**: Implement security testing from requirements phase
- **Developer Security Training**: Build security awareness and testing skills in development teams
- **Automated Security Feedback**: Provide immediate security feedback in development workflow
- **Security Requirements Testing**: Validate security requirements implementation

### 3. Continuous Security Monitoring

- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Implement continuous security monitoring and alerting
- **Security Metrics Tracking**: Monitor security testing effectiveness and coverage
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Incorporate latest threat intelligence into testing
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure ongoing compliance with security standards

### 4. Security Testing Automation

- **Comprehensive Tool Integration**: Implement security testing across the entire development lifecycle
- **Custom Security Test Development**: Build organization-specific security tests
- **Security Regression Prevention**: Automate security regression testing
- **Performance-Aware Security Testing**: Balance security thoroughness with testing performance

## Context Usage Guidelines

**For AI Agents in Security Specialist Role:**
1. Focus on comprehensive security vulnerability detection and validation
2. Implement risk-based testing approaches aligned with threat models
3. Integrate security testing throughout the development and deployment lifecycle
4. Balance automated security testing with manual security assessment
5. Stay current with emerging security threats and testing techniques

**Don't Include:**
- Basic security concepts (use fundamental security contexts)
- Implementation-specific details (use technology-specific security contexts)
- General testing approaches (use general testing contexts)
- Compliance-specific requirements (use compliance-specific contexts)

This context should guide security-focused testing strategies, vulnerability detection, and security validation approaches for specialized security testing scenarios.
