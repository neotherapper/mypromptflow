# React Sub-Agents Patterns

## Overview

This guide provides React-specific patterns for Claude sub-agents implementation, derived from comprehensive research analysis and best practices. Focus on comprehensive domain coverage rather than micro-specialization.

## Recommended React Sub-Agents Architecture

### ✅ OPTIMAL PATTERN: Comprehensive Domain Specialists

```bash
.claude/agents/
├── react-specialist.md              # Complete React development expertise
├── react-performance-specialist.md   # Performance optimization and analysis
├── react-testing-specialist.md       # Testing strategies and implementation
├── react-security-specialist.md      # Security analysis and secure implementation
└── react-accessibility-specialist.md # Accessibility compliance and testing
```

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Over-Specialization

```bash
# Avoid: Too many micro-specialists requiring constant coordination
.claude/agents/
├── react-component-creator.md     # Too narrow
├── react-hook-optimizer.md        # Too narrow  
├── react-state-manager.md         # Too narrow

## Common React Anti-Patterns in Sub-Agents

### Avoid Over-Specialization

**❌ Too Granular**:
```bash
# These should be consolidated into react-specialist
├── jsx-syntax-helper.md
├── props-validator.md  
├── hook-creator.md
├── context-manager.md
└── ref-handler.md
```

**✅ Appropriate Granularity**:
```bash
# Comprehensive coverage with clear boundaries
├── react-specialist.md           # All core React development
├── react-performance-specialist.md  # Performance optimization focus
└── react-testing-specialist.md   # Testing strategy and implementation
```

### Avoid Technology Mixing

**❌ Confused Responsibilities**:
```yaml
# Don't mix React with backend concerns
name: "react-fullstack-specialist"
description: "Handles React frontend and Node.js backend and database design..."
```

**✅ Clear Technology Boundaries**:
```yaml
# Keep React agents focused on frontend concerns
name: "react-specialist"
description: "React development expert for component architecture, state management, and modern React patterns"
```

This pattern ensures optimal React development support through focused, comprehensive specialists while avoiding the coordination overhead of micro-specialized agents.
