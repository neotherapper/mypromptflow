# Python Sub-Agents Patterns

## Overview

This guide provides Python-specific patterns for Claude sub-agents implementation, focusing on comprehensive domain expertise rather than micro-specialization. Python agents cover backend development, data science, automation, and infrastructure concerns.

## Recommended Python Sub-Agents Architecture

### ✅ OPTIMAL PATTERN: Comprehensive Domain Specialists

```bash
.claude/agents/
├── python-backend-specialist.md     # Complete backend development expertise
├── python-data-specialist.md        # Data science and analytics focus
├── python-automation-specialist.md  # DevOps, scripting, and automation
└── python-testing-specialist.md     # Testing strategies and frameworks
```

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Over-Specialization

```bash
# Avoid: Too many narrow Python specialists
.claude/agents/
├── flask-api-creator.md            # Too narrow
├── django-model-optimizer.md       # Too narrow
├── pandas-analyzer.md              # Too narrow
├── pytest-helper.md               # Too narrow
├── docker-builder.md              # Too narrow
├── sql-query-writer.md             # Too narrow
└── async-handler.md                # Too narrow
```

.claude/agents/
├── python-fintech-specialist.md      # Financial domain expertise
├── python-ml-ops-specialist.md       # Machine learning operations
├── python-api-gateway-specialist.md  # API gateway and microservices
└── python-blockchain-specialist.md   # Blockchain and cryptocurrency
```

## Tool Configuration Patterns

```yaml
python_backend_tools:

## Common Python Anti-Patterns in Sub-Agents

### Avoid Framework-Specific Micro-Agents

**❌ Too Granular**:
```bash
# These should be consolidated into python-backend-specialist
├── django-model-creator.md
├── flask-route-builder.md
├── fastapi-validator.md
├── sqlalchemy-optimizer.md
└── celery-task-manager.md
```

**✅ Appropriate Scope**:
```bash
# Comprehensive coverage with clear boundaries
├── python-backend-specialist.md      # All backend development
├── python-data-specialist.md         # Data science and analytics
├── python-automation-specialist.md   # DevOps and automation
└── python-testing-specialist.md      # Testing and quality assurance
```

### Avoid Mixed Domain Responsibilities

**❌ Confused Boundaries**:
```yaml
# Don't mix unrelated Python domains
name: "python-everything-specialist"
description: "Handles web APIs, data science, DevOps, testing, and desktop applications..."
```

**✅ Clear Domain Focus**:
```yaml
# Keep domains clearly separated
name: "python-backend-specialist"
description: "Python backend development expert for web APIs, database integration, and server-side architecture"
```

This pattern ensures optimal Python development support through focused, comprehensive specialists that cover the major Python application domains while maintaining clear boundaries and avoiding coordination overhead.
