## API Integration & Edge Computing

### Cloudflare Workers API
```javascript
// Edge function example
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // API endpoint at the edge
    const url = new URL(request.url)
    
    if (url.pathname === '/api/hello') {
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({
        message: 'Hello from the edge!',
        location: request.cf.city,
        country: request.cf.country
      }), {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
      })
    }
    
    // Static asset serving
    return env.ASSETS.fetch(request)
  }
}
```

### Pages Functions Integration
```typescript
// Type-safe Pages Functions
export const onRequest: PagesFunction<Env> = async (context) => {
  const { request, env, params } = context
  
  // Database integration
  const result = await env.DB.prepare(
    'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?'
  ).bind(params.id).first()
  
  return Response.json(result)
}
```
