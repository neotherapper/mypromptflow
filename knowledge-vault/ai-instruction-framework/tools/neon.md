## API Integration and Automation

### **Neon Management API**

**Branch Management Automation**:
```typescript
// Neon API integration for automated branch management
import { NeonApi } from '@neon/api-client';

class NeonBranchManager {
  private api: NeonApi;
  
  constructor(apiKey: string) {
    this.api = new NeonApi({ apiKey });
  }
  
  async createFeatureBranch(projectId: string, featureName: string) {
    const branch = await this.api.branches.create({
      projectId,
      name: `feature/${featureName}`,
      parent: 'main',
      preserve_data: true
    });
    
    // Wait for branch to be ready
    await this.waitForBranchReady(projectId, branch.id);
    
    return {
      branchId: branch.id,
      connectionString: branch.connection_string,
      ready: true
    };
  }
  
  async mergeFeatureBranch(projectId: string, branchId: string) {
    // Validate migration compatibility
    await this.validateMigrationCompatibility(projectId, branchId);
    
    // Merge changes to main branch
    const result = await this.api.branches.merge({
      projectId,
      sourceBranchId: branchId,
      targetBranch: 'main'
    });
    
    // Cleanup feature branch
    await this.api.branches.delete(projectId, branchId);
    
    return result;
  }
}
```

**Performance Monitoring Integration**:
```python
# Automated performance monitoring and optimization
class NeonPerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, project_id: str):
        self.api = NeonAPI(api_key)
        self.project_id = project_id
    
    async def monitor_performance_metrics(self):
        metrics = await self.api.get_performance_metrics(
            project_id=self.project_id,
            time_range='24h'
        )
        
        # AI-powered performance analysis
        analysis = await self.analyze_performance_trends(metrics)
        
        if analysis['optimization_recommended']:
            await self.apply_optimizations(analysis['recommendations'])
        
        return analysis
    
    async def analyze_performance_trends(self, metrics):

            'scaling_recommendations': self.recommend_scaling_adjustments(metrics)
        }
```

### **Advanced Integration Patterns**

**Multi-Environment Management**:
```typescript
// Environment-specific database management
interface NeonEnvironmentConfig {
  development: {
    projectId: string;
    branch: 'dev';
    computeSize: 'small';
  };
  staging: {
    projectId: string;
    branch: 'staging';
    computeSize: 'medium';
  };
  production: {
    projectId: string;
    branch: 'main';
    computeSize: 'large';
    highAvailability: true;
  };
}

class NeonEnvironmentManager {
  async deployToEnvironment(
    environment: keyof NeonEnvironmentConfig,
    migrationFiles: string[]
  ) {
    const config = this.getEnvironmentConfig(environment);
    
    // Create deployment branch
    const deploymentBranch = await this.createDeploymentBranch(
      config.projectId,
      config.branch,
      environment
    );
    
    // Run migrations on deployment branch
    await this.runMigrations(deploymentBranch, migrationFiles);
    
    // Validate deployment
    await this.validateDeployment(deploymentBranch);
    
    // Promote to target environment
    await this.promoteDeployment(config.projectId, deploymentBranch, config.branch);
    
    return { success: true, environment, deploymentId: deploymentBranch };
  }
}
```

**Disaster Recovery and Backup Management**:
```python
# Automated backup and disaster recovery
class NeonBackupManager:
    async def setup_automated_backups(self, project_id: str):
        # Configure point-in-time recovery
        await self.api.configure_pitr(
            project_id=project_id,
            retention_days=30,
            backup_frequency='hourly'
        )
        
        # Set up cross-region replication
        await self.api.setup_replication(
            project_id=project_id,
            replica_regions=['us-west-2', 'eu-west-1'],
            sync_mode='async'
        )
    
    async def test_disaster_recovery(self, project_id: str):
        # Create recovery test branch
        recovery_point = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=24)
        test_branch = await self.api.create_branch_from_timestamp(
            project_id=project_id,
            timestamp=recovery_point,
            name='disaster-recovery-test'
        )
        
        # Validate data integrity
        integrity_check = await self.validate_data_integrity(test_branch)
        
        # Cleanup test branch
        await self.api.delete_branch(project_id, test_branch.id)
        
        return integrity_check
```

// Intelligent auto-scaling based on usage patterns
class NeonAutoScaler {
  private usagePatterns: UsagePattern[] = [];
  
  async analyzeUsagePatterns() {
    const metrics = await this.collectMetrics('7d');
    
    // AI analysis of usage patterns
    const patterns = await this.identifyPatterns(metrics);
    
    // Predict future resource needs
    const predictions = await this.predictResourceNeeds(patterns);
    
    // Generate scaling recommendations
    return this.generateScalingPlan(predictions);
  }
  
  async implementScalingPlan(plan: ScalingPlan) {
    for (const action of plan.actions) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'scale_compute':
          await this.scaleCompute(action.target_size);
          break;
        case 'optimize_connections':
          await this.optimizeConnectionPooling(action.parameters);
          break;
        case 'schedule_scaling':
          await this.schedulePreemptiveScaling(action.schedule);
          break;
      }
    }
    
    // Monitor scaling effectiveness
    return this.monitorScalingEffectiveness(plan);
  }
}
```

### **Enterprise Integration Patterns**

**Multi-Project Organization**:
```yaml
# Enterprise Neon organization structure
neon_enterprise_config:
  organization:
    name: "Maritime Insurance Corp"
    projects:
      - name: "core-platform"
        environments:
          - production: { branch: "main", compute: "large", ha: true }
          - staging: { branch: "staging", compute: "medium", ha: false }
          - development: { branch: "dev", compute: "small", ha: false }
      
      - name: "analytics-platform"
        environments:
          - production: { branch: "main", compute: "xlarge", ha: true }
          - development: { branch: "dev", compute: "medium", ha: false }
      
      - name: "microservices"
        databases:
          - user_service: { branch: "main", compute: "medium" }
          - policy_service: { branch: "main", compute: "large" }
          - claims_service: { branch: "main", compute: "large" }
```

**Advanced Monitoring and Alerting**:
```python
# Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
class NeonMonitoringSystem:
    async def setup_comprehensive_monitoring(self):
        monitors = [
            self.setup_performance_monitoring(),
            self.setup_cost_monitoring(),
            self.setup_security_monitoring(),
            self.setup_availability_monitoring()
        ]
        
        await asyncio.gather(*monitors)
    
    async def setup_performance_monitoring(self):
        # Query performance alerts
        await self.create_alert({
            'name': 'slow_queries',
            'condition': 'avg_query_time > 1000ms',
            'action': 'trigger_optimization_analysis'
        })
        
        # Connection pool alerts
        await self.create_alert({
            'name': 'connection_pool_exhaustion',
            'condition': 'active_connections > 80% of limit',
            'action': 'scale_compute_tier'
        })
    
    async def setup_cost_monitoring(self):
        # Cost anomaly detection
        await self.create_alert({
            'name': 'cost_anomaly',
            'condition': 'daily_cost > 150% of 7day_average',
            'action': 'trigger_cost_analysis'
        })
```
