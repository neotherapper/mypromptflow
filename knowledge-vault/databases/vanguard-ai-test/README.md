# VanguardAI Test Environment

## Purpose

VanguardAI is a test environment for validating the knowledge vault's 6-database framework with 30 high-priority items identified from comprehensive repository analysis. This test proves that the existing schema can handle the 400+ entities, tools, and concepts discovered across the entire mypromptflow codebase.

## Test Structure

### Directory Organization
- **knowledge_vault_items/** - 5 methodology and framework test items
- **tools_services_items/** - 10 technology and platform test items  
- **business_ideas_items/** - 3 innovation opportunity test items
- **training_vault_items/** - 2 certification and learning test items
- **platforms_sites_items/** - 5 resource and documentation test items
- **notes_ideas_items/** - 5 insight and observation test items

**Total: 30 test items** representing the highest-priority discoveries from repository analysis.

## Validation Goals

### Schema Compliance
- All items follow existing YAML schema structures
- Property types, constraints, and formats validated
- Required fields populated correctly

### Relationship Testing  
- Cross-database relationships implemented bidirectionally
- Hub-spoke architecture validated (all items connect to knowledge_vault)
- Universal connector testing (notes_ideas connects to all databases)

### Functionality Validation
- Tag-based categorization and filtering
- Status workflows operate correctly
- Rating system functions as designed
- Cross-reference navigation works
