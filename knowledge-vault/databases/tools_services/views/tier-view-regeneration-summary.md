## Repository-Aligned Scoring Algorithm v6.0.0 Implementation

### Formula Applied:
```
composite_score = (technology_stack_alignment * 0.40) + 
                  (business_domain_relevance * 0.25) + 
                  (mcp_ecosystem_integration * 0.20) + 
                  (production_readiness * 0.10) + 
                  (maintenance_status * 0.05)
```

### Technology Stack Alignment Criteria:
- **10/10**: Perfect alignment (AWS, GitHub, PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript, Python)
- **8-9/10**: High alignment (complementary development tools)
- **6-7/10**: Moderate alignment (useful but not core)
- **4-5/10**: Low alignment (specialized use cases)
- **2-3/10**: Poor alignment (domain mismatch)

### Business Domain Relevance Criteria:
- **10/10**: Core maritime insurance & AI knowledge management
- **8-9/10**: Enterprise development & cloud infrastructure
- **6-7/10**: General business productivity tools
- **4-5/10**: Specialized domains with limited relevance
- **2-3/10**: Domains not relevant to business focus

## Validation Results

### ✅ Expected Tier Changes Achieved:
1. **AWS MCP Server**: Tier 2 → Tier 1 (Score: 6.4 → 9.5) ✅
2. **Healthcare Servers**: Tier 2 → Tier 4 (AgentCare: 8.9 → 3.9) ✅
3. **Blockchain Servers**: Tier 2 → Tier 4 (WalletMCP: 8.5 → 3.25) ✅
4. **Aviation Servers**: Tier 1 → Tier 4 (FlightRadar: 8.8 → 3.3) ✅
5. **Core Stack Servers**: Maintained Tier 1 with enhanced scores ✅

### ✅ Technology Stack Prioritization:
- AWS servers promoted to Tier 1 (cloud infrastructure priority)
- GitHub/PostgreSQL servers maintained in Tier 1 with higher scores
- Non-aligned domains appropriately demoted to Tier 4

## Implementation Impact

### Phase 1 Critical Infrastructure (Updated):

3. **Validate Business Value**: Measure ROI improvements from repository-aligned prioritization
4. **Update Integration Guides**: Revise deployment documentation for new tier classifications

## Conclusion

The Repository-Aligned Scoring Algorithm v6.0.0 has been successfully implemented across all tier view files. The new classifications properly prioritize technology stack alignment and business domain relevance, resulting in:

- **Better Resource Allocation**: Core infrastructure tools prioritized in Tier 1
- **Improved Business Focus**: Maritime insurance relevance properly weighted
- **Technology Stack Coherence**: Repository technologies receive appropriate priority
- **Experimental Safety**: Misaligned domains safely isolated in Tier 4

All tier views now reflect the mathematical rigor and business alignment requirements of the new scoring methodology.
