});

// Smart caching for frequently accessed data
const dataCache = new Map();
const getCachedTicketData = async (ticketId, cacheTime = 300) => {
  const cacheKey = `ticket_${ticketId}`;
  const cached = dataCache.get(cacheKey);
  
  if (!cached || Date.now() - cached.timestamp > cacheTime * 1000) {
    const data = await zendeskMcp.getTicket(ticketId);
    dataCache.set(cacheKey, {
      data,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      metadata: extractMetadata(data)
    });
  }
  
  return dataCache.get(cacheKey);
};
