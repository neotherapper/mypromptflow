## Advanced Features and Patterns

### Modern REST API Patterns
- **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 123,
    "status": "active",
    "_links": {
      "self": "/api/v1/policies/123",
      "update": "/api/v1/policies/123",
      "claims": "/api/v1/policies/123/claims"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Resource Expansion and Sparse Fieldsets**
  ```http
  GET /api/v1/policies/123?expand=customer,coverage&fields=id,status,premium
  ```

- **Bulk Operations and Batch Processing**
  ```http
  POST /api/v1/policies/batch
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "operations": [
      {"method": "POST", "path": "/policies", "data": {...}},
      {"method": "PUT", "path": "/policies/123", "data": {...}}
    ]
  }
  ```

### Security Best Practices
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless authentication and authorization
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and rotation
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation and sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Request quotas and abuse prevention mechanisms
