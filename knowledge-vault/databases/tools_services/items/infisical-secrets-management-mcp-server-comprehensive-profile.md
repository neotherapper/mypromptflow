## API Interface & Usage

### Primary Operations
```javascript
// Secret retrieval with caching
const secrets = await infisicalMcp.getSecrets({
  environment: 'production',
  path: '/api',
  includeImported: true
});

// Individual secret management
const secret = await infisicalMcp.createSecret({
  key: 'DATABASE_PASSWORD',
  value: 'super_secure_password_123',
  environment: 'production',
  path: '/database',
  comment: 'Primary database connection password',
  tags: ['database', 'critical']
});

// Dynamic secret generation
const dynamicSecret = await infisicalMcp.createDynamicSecret({
  name: 'postgres-credentials',
  provider: 'postgresql',
  defaultTtl: '1h',
  maxTtl: '24h',
  config: {
    host: 'postgres.example.com',
    facility: 5432,
    database: 'production',
    username: 'infisical_admin',
    password: '{{.secrets.POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD}}'
  }
});

// Secret rotation management
await infisicalMcp.rotateSecret({
  secretId: 'secret_12345',
  rotationInterval: '7d',
  notificationSettings: {
    webhook: 'https://your-app.com/webhooks/secret-rotation',
    email: ['security@company.com']
  }
});
```

### Advanced Security Patterns
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Never store secrets in application code or configuration files
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal permissions for service accounts and applications
- **Secret Sprawl Prevention**: Centralized secret management across all environments
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance reporting and audit trail generation
- **Incident Response**: Automated secret revocation and rotation during security incidents

## Integration Patterns

### Application Integration
```javascript
// Node.js application integration
const InfisicalClient = require('@infisical/sdk');

const client = new InfisicalClient({
  token: process.env.INFISICAL_TOKEN,
  siteURL: process.env.INFISICAL_API_URL || 'https://app.infisical.com'
});

// Runtime secret retrieval with caching
async function getSecretWithCache(key, environment = 'production') {
  try {
    const secret = await client.getSecret({
      secretName: key,
      environment: environment,
      projectId: process.env.INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID
    });
    
    return secret.secretValue;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to retrieve secret ${key}:`, error);
    throw new Error('Secret retrieval failed');
  }
}

// Database connection with dynamic secrets
async function getDatabaseConnection() {
  const dbConfig = {
    host: await getSecretWithCache('DB_HOST'),
    facility: await getSecretWithCache('DB_PORT'),
    database: await getSecretWithCache('DB_NAME'),
    username: await getSecretWithCache('DB_USERNAME'),

### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Efficient secret caching and batch retrieval
class SecretCache {
  constructor(ttl = 300) {
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.ttl = ttl * 1000; // Convert to milliseconds
  }
  
  async getSecrets(keys, environment) {
    const uncachedKeys = [];
    const results = {};
    
    // Check cache first
    for (const key of keys) {
      const cached = this.cache.get(`${environment}:${key}`);
      if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < this.ttl) {
        results[key] = cached.value;
      } else {
        uncachedKeys.push(key);
      }
    }
    
    // Batch fetch uncached secrets
    if (uncachedKeys.length > 0) {
      const secrets = await infisicalMcp.batchGetSecrets({
        keys: uncachedKeys,
        environment: environment
      });
      
      // Update cache and results
      for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(secrets)) {
        this.cache.set(`${environment}:${key}`, {
          value,
          timestamp: Date.now()
        });
        results[key] = value;
      }
    }
    
    return results;
  }
}
```
