## Advanced Features and Patterns

### GraphQL Federation v2 Implementation
```graphql
# Insurance Service Schema MCP Server
type Policy @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  status: PolicyStatus!
  premium: Float!
  asset: asset @provides(fields: "imo name")
}

# asset Service Schema  
type asset @key(fields: "imo") @extends {
  imo: String! @external
  name: String! @external
  specifications: VesselSpecs
  currentLocation: Location
}

# Claims Service Schema
type Claim @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  policy: Policy @provides(fields: "id")
  status: ClaimStatus!
  estimatedLoss: Float
}
```

### Progressive Data Loading with Defer/Stream
```graphql
query PolicyDetailsWithDefer($policyId: ID!) {
  policy(id: $policyId) {
    id
    status
    premium
    asset {
      imo
      name
    }
    ... @defer(label: "claims") {
      claims {
        id
        status
        estimatedLoss
        documents {
          id
          name
          size
        }
      }
    }
    ... @defer(label: "riskAnalysis") {
      riskAnalysis {
        score
        factors
        recommendations
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Scalars for business Data
```graphql
# Custom scalar definitions
scalar DateTime
scalar Coordinate
scalar Currency
scalar IMONumber

type Position {
  latitude: Coordinate!
  longitude: Coordinate!
  timestamp: DateTime!
  accuracy: Float
}

type asset {
  imo: IMONumber!
  position: Position
  specifications: VesselSpecs
}

type Policy {
  premium: Currency!
  effectiveDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime!
}
```
