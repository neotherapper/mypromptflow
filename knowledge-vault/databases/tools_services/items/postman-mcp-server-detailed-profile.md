```

### Dynamic Environment Management
```javascript
// Environment Variables
{
    "base_url": "https://api.business-insurance.com/v1",
    "auth_url": "https://auth.business-insurance.com",
    "client_id": "{{$secretValue}}",
    "client_secret": "{{$secretValue}}",
    "access_token": "",
    "policy_id": "",
    "vessel_imo": "1234567890",
    "test_email": "test@example.com"
}

// Pre-request Script for Token Management
if (!pm.environment.get('access_token') || 
    Date.now() > pm.environment.get('token_expiry')) {
    
    pm.sendRequest({
        url: pm.environment.get('auth_url') + '/token',
        method: 'POST',
        header: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: {
            mode: 'raw',
            raw: JSON.stringify({
                grant_type: 'client_credentials',
                client_id: pm.environment.get('client_id'),
                client_secret: pm.environment.get('client_secret')
            })
        }
    }, function(err, res) {
        if (res && res.code === 200) {
            const tokenData = res.json();
            pm.environment.set('access_token', tokenData.access_token);
            pm.environment.set('token_expiry', 
                Date.now() + (tokenData.expires_in * 1000));
        }
    });
}
```

### Comprehensive Test Patterns
```javascript
// business operations Specific Test Patterns

// Premium Calculation Validation
pm.test("Premium calculation follows business risk factors", function() {
    const response = pm.response.json();
    const factors = response.premium_factors;
    
    // Validate business-specific factors are included
    pm.expect(factors).to.have.property('vessel_age');
    pm.expect(factors).to.have.property('trade_area');
    pm.expect(factors).to.have.property('cargo_type');
    pm.expect(factors).to.have.property('captain_experience');
    
    // Validate factor ranges
    pm.expect(factors.vessel_age).to.be.within(0, 50);
    pm.expect(factors.trade_area).to.be.oneOf(['coastal', 'worldwide', 'european']);
    pm.expect(factors.captain_experience).to.be.above(0);
});

// Policy Validation Schema
pm.test("Policy response schema validation", function() {
    const schema = {
        type: "object",
        required: ["id", "status", "asset", "coverage", "premium"],
        properties: {
            id: { type: "string", pattern: "^pol_[a-zA-Z0-9]+$" },
            status: { type: "string", enum: ["draft", "active", "suspended"] },
            asset: {
                type: "object",
                required: ["imo", "name", "flag"],
                properties: {
                    imo: { type: "string", pattern: "^[0-9]{7}$" },
                    name: { type: "string", minLength: 1 },
                    flag: { type: "string", pattern: "^[A-Z]{2}$" }
                }
            },
            coverage: {
                type: "object",
                required: ["asset", "inventory"],
                properties: {
                    asset: { type: "number", minimum: 0 },
                    inventory: { type: "number", minimum: 0 }
                }
            },
            premium: { type: "number", minimum: 0 }
        }
    };
    
    pm.response.to.have.jsonSchema(schema);
});
