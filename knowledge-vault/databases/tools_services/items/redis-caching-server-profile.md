    "keyspace_misses",
    "evicted_keys"
  ],
  alertThresholds: {
    memoryUsage: 85,          // Alert at 85% memory usage
    hitRatio: 0.8,            // Alert if hit ratio < 80%
    connectionCount: 8000,     // Alert at 8000 connections
    evictionRate: 100         // Alert if evicting > 100 keys/sec
