  }
}
```

## API Interface & Usage

### Primary Operations
```javascript
// Send message to channel
await slackMcp.sendMessage({
  channel: "#development",
  text: "Deployment completed successfully",
  attachments: [
    {
      color: "good",
      title: "Build Status",
      text: "All tests passed"
    }
  ]
});

// Create notification workflow
await slackMcp.createNotification({
  trigger: "github-pr-opened",
  channel: "#code-review",
  template: "New PR: {{title}} by {{author}}"
});

// Retrieve channel history
const messages = await slackMcp.getChannelHistory({
  channel: "#general",
  limit: 50,
  oldest: "2024-01-01"
});
```

### Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Batch message processing
const batchMessages = await slackMcp.batchSend({
  messages: [
    { channel: "#dev", text: "Build started" },
    { channel: "#ops", text: "Deployment initiated" }
  ],
  batchSize: 10,
  rateLimitStrategy: "adaptive"
});

// Efficient channel management
const channelCache = new Map();
const getChannelId = async (channelName) => {
  if (!channelCache.has(channelName)) {
    const channel = await slackMcp.findChannel(channelName);
    channelCache.set(channelName, channel.id);
  }
  return channelCache.get(channelName);
};
```
