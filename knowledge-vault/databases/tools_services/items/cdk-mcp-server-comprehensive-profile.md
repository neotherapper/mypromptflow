### Tier 1 Justification
The CDK MCP Server achieves Tier 1 status through exceptional enterprise adoption, comprehensive AWS service coverage, robust security validation capabilities, and critical role in modern infrastructure as code practices. Its integration with AWS Well-Architected Framework principles, extensive pattern library, and multi-language support make it indispensable for enterprise cloud infrastructure development.

## Security Considerations

### CDK Nag Integration Security
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Real-time validation against AWS security best practices during CDK synthesis
- **Suppression Oversight**: Human review requirements for security rule suppressions with audit trail maintenance
- **Compliance Framework Integration**: Support for HIPAA, SOC, PCI-DSS, and other regulatory compliance requirements
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Automated IAM policy validation and optimization recommendations

### Enterprise Security Controls
```typescript
interface SecurityControlFramework {
  accessControls: {
    iamPolicyValidation: "Automated least privilege validation";
    crossAccountAccess: "Secure cross-account role assumption patterns";
    resourceBasedPolicies: "Service-specific resource policy optimization";
    temporaryCredentials: "STS token-based authentication workflows";
  };
  
  dataProtection: {
    encryptionAtRest: "KMS key management and rotation automation";
    encryptionInTransit: "TLS/SSL configuration validation and enforcement";
    secretsManagement: "Parameter Store and Secrets Manager integration";
    dataClassification: "Automated data sensitivity tagging and protection";
  };
  
  networkSecurity: {
    vpcConfiguration: "Secure VPC design patterns with private subnets";
    securityGroups: "Principle of least privilege network access controls";
    nacls: "Network ACL configuration for defense in depth";
    vpnConnectivity: "Secure hybrid cloud connectivity patterns";
  };
  
  monitoring: {
    cloudTrailIntegration: "Comprehensive API call logging and analysis";
    configRules: "Automated compliance monitoring and alerting";
    guardDutyIntegration: "Threat detection and incident response workflows";
    securityHubAggregation: "Centralized security findings management";
  };
}
```

### Best Practices and Recommendations
1. **Always Review CDK Nag Warnings**: Treat security warnings as blocking issues requiring either remediation or documented suppression with business justification
2. **Implement Layered Security**: Use multiple security controls including CDK Nag rules, WAF configurations, and runtime security monitoring
3. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review suppression justifications and update security configurations based on evolving threat landscape
4. **Environment Segregation**: Implement strict separation between development, staging, and production environments with appropriate security controls
5. **Automation First**: Prefer automated security controls over manual processes to reduce human error and ensure consistent application
