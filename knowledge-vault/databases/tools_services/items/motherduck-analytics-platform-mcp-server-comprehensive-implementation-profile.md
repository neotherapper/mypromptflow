## Integration Patterns

### Modern Data Stack Integration
**Pattern**: Zero-ETL Analytics Platform  
**Use Case**: Direct analysis of data lake files without transformation  
**Implementation**: DuckDB native connectors with S3/GCS/Azure integration  
**Benefits**: Eliminate ETL pipelines, reduce data movement, real-time analytics
