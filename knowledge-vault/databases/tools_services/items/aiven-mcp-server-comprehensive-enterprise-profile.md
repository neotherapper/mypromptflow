### Usage Examples
```typescript
// Service Creation and Management
const postgresService = await service_create({
  serviceName: "api-database",
  serviceType: "pg",
  plan: "business-4",
  cloud: "aws-us-east-1",
  userConfig: {
    pg_version: "15",
    pg: {
      max_connections: 100,
      shared_preload_libraries: "pg_stat_statements"
    }
  }
});

// Database and User Management
await database_create("api-database", "application_db");
const dbUser = await user_create("api-database", "app_user", "secure_password");

// Performance Monitoring
const metrics = await metrics_get("api-database", {
  start: "1h",
  metrics: ["cpu_usage", "memory_usage", "connections", "queries_per_second"]
});

// Automated Backup
const backup = await backup_create("api-database", `backup-${Date.now()}`);
```

### Advanced Management Patterns
```typescript
// Intelligent Scaling Based on Metrics
async function autoScale(serviceName: string) {
  const metrics = await metrics_get(serviceName, { start: "15m" });
  const currentConfig = await config_get(serviceName);
  
  if (metrics.cpu_usage.avg > 80 && metrics.memory_usage.avg > 85) {
    const nextPlan = calculateNextPlan(currentConfig.plan);
    return await service_update(serviceName, { plan: nextPlan });
  }
  
  return { scaled: false, reason: "No scaling needed" };
}

// Multi-Service Health Monitoring
async function healthCheck(serviceNames: string[]) {
  const healthChecks = await Promise.all(
    serviceNames.map(async name => ({
      service: name,
      health: await health_check(name),
      metrics: await metrics_get(name, { start: "5m" })
    }))
  );
  
  return {
    overall: calculateOverallHealth(healthChecks),
    individual: healthChecks,
    alerts: generateAlerts(healthChecks)
  };
}

// Disaster Recovery Orchestration
async function initiateDisasterRecovery(primaryService: string, targetCloud: string) {
  const latestBackup = await backup_list(primaryService)
    .then(backups => backups.sort((a, b) => b.created_at - a.created_at)[0]);
  
  const recoveryService = await service_create({
    serviceName: `${primaryService}-recovery`,
    serviceType: "pg",
    plan: "business-4",
    cloud: targetCloud
  });
  
  return await backup_restore(recoveryService.serviceName, latestBackup.backup_id);
}
```
