});

// Smart caching for frequent calendar access
const calendarCache = new Map();
const getCachedCalendarData = async (calendarId, cacheTime = 300) => {
  const cacheKey = `calendar_${calendarId}`;
  if (!calendarCache.has(cacheKey) || 
      Date.now() - calendarCache.get(cacheKey).timestamp > cacheTime * 1000) {
    const data = await googleCalendarMcp.getCalendarEvents(calendarId);
