## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Characteristics
- **File Listing**: 200ms-800ms depending on folder size and filtering complexity
- **File Download**: 1-10s based on file size and network conditions
- **File Upload**: 2-30s with resumable upload for large files
- **Search Operations**: 500ms-2s for complex content and metadata queries
- **Permission Changes**: 300ms-1s depending on user count and sharing complexity

### Scalability Considerations
- **API Quotas**: 1,000 read/300 write requests per 100 seconds per user
- **File Size**: Up to 5TB per file with Google Workspace unlimited storage
- **Concurrent Operations**: 100 requests per 100 seconds per user across all operations
- **Batch Processing**: 10-50 files per batch operation for efficiency optimization
- **Enterprise Scale**: Supports millions of files with proper quota management

### Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Efficient batch file operations
const batchFileOps = await googleDriveMcp.batchOperations({
  operations: [
    { type: "list", folder_id: "folder1" },
    { type: "download", file_id: "file1", export_format: "pdf" },
    { type: "share", file_id: "file2", permissions: shareConfig }
  ],
  batch_size: 25,
  rate_limit_strategy: "exponential_backoff"
});

// Smart caching for frequent operations
const fileCache = new Map();
const getCachedFileMetadata = async (fileId, cacheTime = 600) => {
  const cacheKey = `file_${fileId}`;
  if (!fileCache.has(cacheKey) || 
      Date.now() - fileCache.get(cacheKey).timestamp > cacheTime * 1000) {
    const metadata = await googleDriveMcp.getFileMetadata(fileId);
    fileCache.set(cacheKey, { metadata, timestamp: Date.now() });
  }
  return fileCache.get(cacheKey).metadata;
};
```

## Security & Compliance

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication and Authorization Failures**
   - Verify OAuth 2.0 credentials or service account configuration
   - Check API scopes and ensure sufficient Drive API permissions
   - Validate service account domain-wide delegation settings
   - Review credential expiration and refresh token handling

2. **Quota and Rate Limiting Issues**
   - Implement exponential backoff retry strategies for rate limits
   - Monitor API usage against quotas and optimize request patterns
   - Use batch operations to reduce API call frequency
   - Consider Google Workspace upgrade for higher quotas

3. **File Operations and Permission Errors**
   - Verify file IDs and ensure files exist and are accessible
   - Check user/service account permissions on target files and folders
   - Review sharing settings and organizational access policies
   - Handle deleted/trashed files with appropriate error responses

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Test Drive API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     "https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/about"

# Verify file permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     "https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/$FILE_ID/permissions"

# Check quota usage
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     "https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/about?fields=storageQuota"
```

### Performance Monitoring
- **API Response Time**: Monitor file operation latency and performance trends
- **Quota Usage**: Track API quota consumption and rate limit patterns
- **Error Rate Analysis**: Monitor authentication failures and permission errors
