## Integration Patterns

### Enterprise Knowledge Management
```yaml
# Automated documentation workflow
- name: Technical Documentation Sync
  trigger: code_repository_update
  actions:
    - extract_technical_specifications
    - create_notion_documentation_page
    - update_project_database_status
    - notify_team_members
  optimization: content_freshness
```

### Collaborative Workflow Integration
- **Project Management**: Integration with development workflows and task tracking
- **Content Creation**: Automated content generation from templates and data sources
- **Team Communication**: Comment-based collaboration with notification systems
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Cross-team documentation and best practice sharing
- **Reporting Automation**: Automated report generation from database queries

### Common Integration Scenarios
1. **Documentation Automation**: Auto-generated technical documentation from code repositories
2. **Project Dashboards**: Real-time project status tracking with database queries
3. **Meeting Notes**: Automated meeting summary creation and action item tracking
4. **Knowledge Base**: Centralized information repository with search and discovery
5. **Team Onboarding**: Automated onboarding documentation and task assignment

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Characteristics
- **Page Creation**: 500ms-1.5s for complex pages with multiple blocks
- **Database Queries**: 200ms-800ms for filtered queries with up to 100 results
- **Content Updates**: 300ms-600ms for property and content modifications
- **Search Operations**: 400ms-1.2s for full-text search across workspace
- **Bulk Operations**: Optimized batch processing for large-scale content management

### Scalability Considerations
- **Workspace Size**: Supports large workspaces with thousands of pages and databases
- **Concurrent Users**: Multiple team members with shared access and collaboration
- **API Rate Limits**: 3 requests/second with proper rate limiting and queuing
- **Content Volume**: Efficient handling of rich content and media attachments
- **Team Scale**: Scales from individual use to enterprise team collaboration

### Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Efficient batch content operations
const batchContentOps = await notionMcp.batchOperations({
  operations: [
    { type: "create_page", data: pageData1 },
    { type: "update_page", data: pageData2 },
    { type: "query_database", data: queryData }
  ],
  batch_size: 25,
  rate_limit_strategy: "token_bucket"
});

// Smart caching for frequent database queries
const databaseCache = new Map();
const getCachedDatabaseQuery = async (databaseId, filter, cacheTime = 300) => {
  const cacheKey = `db_${databaseId}_${JSON.stringify(filter)}`;
  if (!databaseCache.has(cacheKey) || 
      Date.now() - databaseCache.get(cacheKey).timestamp > cacheTime * 1000) {
    const data = await notionMcp.queryDatabase({ database_id: databaseId, filter });
    databaseCache.set(cacheKey, { data, timestamp: Date.now() });
  }
  return databaseCache.get(cacheKey).data;
};
```

   - Handle token refresh and renewal mechanisms

2. **Permission Access Errors**
   - Verify page and database sharing permissions
   - Check workspace admin settings and access policies
   - Ensure integration permissions match required operations
   - Handle different permission levels (read, write, admin)

3. **Rate Limiting and Performance**
   - Implement proper rate limiting with exponential backoff
   - Optimize batch operations to reduce API call frequency
   - Monitor API usage patterns and quota consumption
   - Use caching strategies for frequently accessed content

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Test Notion API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
     "https://api.notion.com/v1/users/me"

# Verify workspace access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
     "https://api.notion.com/v1/search" \
     -d '{"query": "", "page_size": 1}'
