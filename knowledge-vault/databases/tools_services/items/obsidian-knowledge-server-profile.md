## API Interface & Usage

### Primary Operations
```javascript
// Create linked note with metadata and connections
await obsidianMcp.createNote({
  title: "Software Architecture Principles",
  path: "architecture/principles/software-architecture-principles.md",
  content: `# Software Architecture Principles

## Overview
This document outlines core [[Architecture Principles]] for our development team.
Related: [[Design Patterns]], [[System Design]], [[Code Standards]]

## Key Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each component should have a single reason to change.
- Related: [[SOLID Principles]]
- Examples: [[Component Design Examples]]

### 2. Dependency Inversion
Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
- Implementation: [[Dependency Injection Patterns]]
- Testing: [[Unit Testing Best Practices]]

## Implementation Guidelines
- [ ] Review existing codebase for principle violations
- [ ] Update coding standards documentation
- [ ] Create training materials for team
- [ ] Implement architectural decision records

- **Project Tracking**: Task and milestone tracking with visual progress indicators
- **Learning Management**: Personal and team learning path documentation
- **Research Organization**: Academic and technical research with citation management

## Integration Patterns

### Team Knowledge Management
```yaml
# Collaborative documentation workflow
- name: Team Knowledge Sync
  trigger: note_creation_or_update
  actions:
    - validate_note_structure
    - update_knowledge_graph
    - notify_relevant_team_members
    - sync_to_shared_repository
  optimization: knowledge_connectivity
```

### Development Workflow Integration
- **Documentation as Code**: Git-integrated documentation with version control
- **Code Documentation**: Automated code documentation linking and maintenance
- **Decision Records**: Architectural decision documentation with relationship tracking
- **Meeting Notes**: Automated meeting documentation with action item extraction
- **Learning Resources**: Team knowledge base with skill tracking and development paths

### Common Integration Scenarios
1. **Technical Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation with cross-references
2. **Project Knowledge**: Project-specific information with timeline and milestone tracking
3. **Personal Knowledge**: Individual learning and research documentation
4. **Team Onboarding**: Structured onboarding documentation with progress tracking
5. **Research Management**: Academic and technical research with citation and relationship tracking

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Characteristics
- **Note Creation**: 50ms-200ms for standard notes with linking
- **Search Operations**: 100ms-500ms for full-text search across large vaults
- **Graph Generation**: 200ms-2s for knowledge graph visualization
- **Plugin Operations**: Variable based on plugin complexity and vault size
- **Sync Performance**: Dependent on sync method and vault size (Git, Obsidian Sync, etc.)

### Scalability Considerations
- **Vault Size**: Handles vaults with 10,000+ notes efficiently
- **Link Density**: Optimized for high-density linking and relationship tracking
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple users with shared vaults and synchronization
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extensive plugin support with minimal performance impact
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent performance across desktop and mobile platforms

### Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Efficient vault operations with caching
const vaultCache = new Map();
const getCachedNoteContent = async (notePath, cacheTime = 300) => {
  const cacheKey = `note_${notePath}`;
  const cached = vaultCache.get(cacheKey);
  
  if (!cached || Date.now() - cached.timestamp > cacheTime * 1000) {
    const content = await obsidianMcp.readNote(notePath);
    vaultCache.set(cacheKey, {
      content,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      links: extractLinks(content),
      metadata: extractFrontmatter(content)
    });
  }
  
  return vaultCache.get(cacheKey);
};

// Batch operations for bulk note management
const batchNoteOps = await obsidianMcp.batchOperations({
  operations: [
    { type: "create", data: noteData1 },
    { type: "update", data: noteData2 },
    { type: "link_analysis", data: graphQuery }
  ],
  batch_size: 50,
  preserve_order: true
});

// Smart indexing for search optimization
const searchIndex = await obsidianMcp.buildSearchIndex({
  includeContent: true,
  includeMetadata: true,
  includeLinks: true,
  indexTags: true,
  rebuildThreshold: 100
});
```

## Security & Compliance

### Security Framework
- **Local Data Storage**: All data stored locally with file system permissions
- **Sync Security**: Encrypted synchronization for team collaboration
- **Plugin Security**: Plugin sandboxing and permission management
- **Access Control**: File-level access control through operating system
- **Data Integrity**: Version control and backup strategies for data protection

### Enterprise Considerations
- **Data Governance**: Local data control with organizational policy compliance
- **Version Control**: Git integration for comprehensive change tracking
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated backup solutions for vault protection
- **Team Security**: Shared vault security with controlled access
- **Compliance**: Organizational compliance through data locality and control

### Privacy & Data Protection
- **Local First**: All data remains under user control on local systems
- **Selective Sync**: Choose what content to synchronize with team members
- **Encryption**: Optional vault encryption for sensitive content
- **Export Control**: Full data export capabilities for migration and backup
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Plain markdown files ensure data portability

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Vault Sync Conflicts**
   - Implement proper conflict resolution strategies
   - Use Git-based workflows for team collaboration
   - Configure appropriate .gitignore for Obsidian-specific files
   - Handle concurrent editing through collaborative plugins

2. **Plugin Compatibility Issues**
   - Regularly update plugins and Obsidian application
   - Test plugin combinations for conflicts
   - Use plugin profiles for different use cases
   - Monitor plugin performance impact

3. **Performance with Large Vaults**
   - Optimize vault structure and organization
   - Use selective indexing for search performance
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed notes
   - Consider vault partitioning for very large knowledge bases

### Diagnostic Procedures
```bash
# Check vault integrity and structure
find "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" -name "*.md" | wc -l
find "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\[\[.*\]\]" {} \; | wc -l

# Analyze vault statistics
obsidian-cli analyze-vault --path "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" --include-stats

# Test plugin functionality
obsidian-cli test-plugins --vault "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" --plugin-list core-plugins.json

# Validate markdown syntax
find "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" -name "*.md" -exec markdownlint {} \;
```
