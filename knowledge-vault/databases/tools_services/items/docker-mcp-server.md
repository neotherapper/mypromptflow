**Enterprise-grade containerization platform integration for development workflow automation and deployment orchestration through MCP**

## ðŸ“‹ Basic Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Provider** | Docker Inc./Community |
| **Category** | Containerization Platform |
| **Production Readiness** | 87% |
| **Setup Complexity** | Moderate (5/10) |
| **Repository** | [Docker MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/docker) |

## ðŸ“Š Information Access Capabilities  

### Primary Information Types
- **Container Management**: Real-time container status, resource usage, and lifecycle operations
- **Image Operations**: Docker image building, registry management, and security scanning
- **Network Configuration**: Container networking, service discovery, and load balancing
- **Volume Management**: Persistent storage, data volumes, and backup operations
- **Build Analytics**: Dockerfile optimization, build logs, and performance metrics
- **Security Assessment**: Vulnerability scanning, compliance checking, and access control

### Access Patterns
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live container status and resource usage tracking
- **Streaming Logs**: Continuous access to container logs and build output
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk container management and image processing
- **On-demand Operations**: Immediate container start/stop and image builds

### Authentication & Security
- **Authentication Required**: Docker daemon access via Unix socket or TLS certificates
- **Rate Limits**: Low (depends on local Docker daemon capacity)
- **Security**: Container isolation, image signing with Docker Content Trust
- **Access Control**: Docker daemon permissions and role-based access

## ðŸš€ Core Capabilities & Features

### Container Lifecycle Management
- **Full Operations**: Create, start, stop, restart, and delete containers with configuration management
- **Resource Control**: CPU, memory, and storage limits with real-time monitoring
- **Health Monitoring**: Container health checks and automated restart policies

### Image Operations
- **Build Automation**: Multi-stage builds with BuildKit support and layer optimization
- **Registry Management**: Push, pull, tag, and manage images across registries
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment and compliance reporting

### Development Integration
- **Environment Standardization**: Consistent development environments across team members
- **Hot Reloading**: Live code changes during development with volume mounting
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated building, testing, and deployment pipelines

### Multi-Container Orchestration
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service application management and coordination
- **Service Discovery**: Inter-container communication and load balancing
- **Network Management**: Custom networks and traffic routing configuration

### Typical Use Cases for AI Agents
- **Development Setup**: "Create standardized development environment with database and cache containers"
- **Performance Monitoring**: "Monitor container resource usage and optimize memory allocation"
- **Deployment Automation**: "Build and deploy application with automated testing and rollback"
- **Security Analysis**: "Scan container images for vulnerabilities and generate security reports"
- **Environment Management**: "Manage multi-stage environments from development to production"
- **Troubleshooting**: "Analyze container logs and diagnose application deployment issues"
