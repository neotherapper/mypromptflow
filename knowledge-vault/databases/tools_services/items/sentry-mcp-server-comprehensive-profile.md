  beforeSend(event) {
    // Filter out development/test errors
    if (event.environment === 'development') return null;
    
    // Rate limit noisy errors
    const errorFingerprint = event.fingerprint;
    if (isNoisy(errorFingerprint)) return null;
    
    return event;
  },
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.Dedupe(),
    new Sentry.Integrations.ExtraErrorData()
  ]
};

// Batch API operations for efficiency
