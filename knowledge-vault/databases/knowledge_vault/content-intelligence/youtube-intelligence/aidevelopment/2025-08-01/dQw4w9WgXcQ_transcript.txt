        Welcome to this programming fundamentals course. Today we'll cover essential concepts that every developer should understand, regardless of the programming language they choose.

        Let's start with clean code principles. Clean code is readable, maintainable, and expressive. It tells a story and makes the developer's intent clear. Here are key principles:

        1. Meaningful names: Choose descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
        2. Small functions: Functions should do one thing well
        3. Clear comments: Comment why, not what
        4. Consistent formatting: Use consistent indentation and spacing

        Data structures are fundamental to programming. Understanding when to use arrays, objects, maps, sets, and other structures is crucial for writing efficient code.

        Arrays are ordered collections:
        - Use for sequential data
        - Good for iteration
        - Access by index is O(1)

        Objects/Maps are key-value pairs:
        - Use for associative data
        - Good for lookups
        - Access by key is typically O(1)

        Algorithm complexity matters. Big O notation helps us understand performance:
        - O(1): Constant time - hash table lookups
        - O(log n): Logarithmic time - binary search
        - O(n): Linear time - array iteration
        - O(n²): Quadratic time - nested loops

        Error handling is not optional. Always anticipate what can go wrong and handle errors gracefully:
        - Validate input data
        - Handle network failures
        - Provide meaningful error messages
        - Log errors for debugging

        Testing ensures code quality:
        - Unit tests verify individual functions
        - Integration tests verify component interactions
        - End-to-end tests verify complete workflows
        - Write tests before fixing bugs

        Version control with Git is essential:
        - Commit frequently with meaningful messages
        - Use branches for features and experiments
        - Review code before merging
        - Keep a clean commit history

        Database fundamentals apply to most applications:
        - Understand CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
        - Learn about relationships between data
        - Understand indexing for performance
        - Consider data consistency and transactions

        API design principles:
        - RESTful endpoints are predictable
        - Use appropriate HTTP methods
        - Return consistent response formats
        - Include proper error status codes
        - Document your APIs thoroughly

        Security should be built in, not bolted on:
        - Validate and sanitize all input
        - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
        - Implement proper authentication and authorization
        - Keep dependencies updated
        - Follow the principle of least privilege

        Performance optimization strategies:
        - Profile before optimizing
        - Cache expensive operations
        - Minimize database queries
        - Optimize critical paths first
        - Consider lazy loading for resources

        Code organization and architecture:
        - Separate concerns into different modules
        - Use dependency injection for flexibility
        - Follow SOLID principles
        - Consider design patterns for common problems
        - Keep business logic separate from presentation

        Debugging is a skill that improves with practice:
        - Use debugging tools effectively
        - Read error messages carefully
        - Isolate problems systematically
        - Reproduce issues consistently
        - Document solutions for future reference

        Continuous learning is essential in programming:
        - Stay updated with industry trends
        - Practice coding regularly
        - Contribute to open source projects
        - Learn from code reviews
        - Teach others to reinforce your knowledge

        These fundamentals apply across languages and frameworks. Master these concepts, and you'll be able to adapt to any technology stack.
