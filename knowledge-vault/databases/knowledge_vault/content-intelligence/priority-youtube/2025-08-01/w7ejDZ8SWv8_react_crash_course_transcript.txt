REACT CRASH COURSE TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

[Music]
hey guys welcome to my 2021 react crash
course
so it's been about two years or so since
my last one and i wanted to create an
updated version and this course is meant
for beginners i'll be explaining some of
the core concepts and fundamentals of
react
we're going to be building a task
tracker application
looking at components props state we're
going to
use react hooks and we're also going to
be
dealing with something called json
server which is a mock rest api or
kind of like a fake back end that we can
use so i can show you how we would use
react in a full stack application
where we're making requests to an api
we're going to look at routing
and a whole bunch of other stuff so the
first thing i want to do is just go
through some slides and then we'll go
ahead and jump into
writing code so first off what is react
the standard definition is it's a
javascript library for building user
interfaces
and you may have heard of it referred to
as a framework i refer to it as a
framework most people do and i'll talk
about
why in a second now react is uh it was
created and it's maintained by facebook
it's strictly front end meaning it runs
in the browser when you have a web app
that's built with let's say php
you're you're running php on the server
your app is hosted on the server and
then
it serves html templates or html pages
to the client
with react you build what's called a
single page application
or a spa where you have a single html
page and then all of your routing
all that stuff is done through react
which then compiles to a javascript
bundle that's loaded by the browser
so it makes for really fast and
interactive interfaces
now even though react is a front-end
framework so if you can't directly
for instance communicate with your
database
it's often used in combination with
other technologies to create a full
stack application
for instance the mern stack which is
really popular it's mongodb which is a
type of database
express which is a back-end framework
react and then node.js which is a
javascript runtime
you could also use react on the front
end and use php laravel on the back end
or python django
and what you would do is you would you
would serve json data from your server
and you would make requests from react
to the server
to get data to to add data update delete
and so on
now as far as being a library versus a
framework
most people call it a framework and
that's because it's directly comparable
to
something like angular or vue.js now it
doesn't
have as much included as angular does
like angular has a built-in routing
system
react doesn't you just have to install
an extra package called react router dom
so it has an entire ecosystem of
packages that you can install to make it
function as a full-fledged framework
now as far as a library goes when i
think of a library i think of like
jquery
low dash something where you you pull
utilities in and you use them in your
application
react doesn't work like that it works
more like like
angular or view and those three are
actually the top frameworks in the
industry right now
uh i would go as far as to say react is
the most popular
but the other two are great as well i
have crash courses on those
i'll be updating soon so when you're
choosing one of these three frameworks
if you're you know if you're going to be
a front-end developer or full stack
developer
you just want to compare them use each
one test them out see what
what you really click with and also look
at jobs in your area if that's what if
that's what your goal is
all right so we know that react is a
front end library slash framework
now why would you want to use it there's
actually a bunch of reasons but one of
the biggest
is it gives you a way to structure the
view layer of your application
so mvc or model view controller is a
popular design pattern for software
the model deals with the data the
controller deals with the requests and
routing
and then the view is the ui the user
interface the part of the app that the
user sees
react is basically the v in mvc
now if you've tried to build a large
dynamic interface using javascript
vanilla javascript it can get really
messy your html
your styling and your javascript logic
are just all over the place
and everyone writes vanilla javascript
differently
react allows you to build your ui using
what are called reusable components
so every part of your user interface is
looked at as a dynamic component
that can hold its own state and data
we also don't have to separate our
markup from our logic because react uses
something called jsx or javascript
syntax extension
and this allows us to to basically write
dynamic html
it's actually javascript but it's
formatted like html
we can even embed javascript expressions
variables etc now
the apps that you build with react are
very interactive because it uses
something called the virtual dom
which is the document object model so it
what this does it allows you to update
parts of the page that need to be
updated
without reloading it so if you have a
list of users or in our case a list of
tasks
and you want to delete one of them it
doesn't have to reload the page it does
everything behind the scenes
if you were to build let's say a
traditional php application where you're
just serving
html templates every delete you make it
most likely is going to have to refresh
the page
so this makes things much more faster
more dynamic and interactive
react also has performance and testing
benefits
another huge reason to learn react is
it's it's very big in the industry right
now
just by the way it structures everything
it makes it much easier to work on
projects with teams
rather than just having you know a bunch
of jumbled javascript
so managing data is also really easy
with one-way data binding
all the data in your state is immutable
meaning you can't mutate it directly
and react provides ways to to basically
recreate your state every time that it
needs to be changed
so this this helps with debugging and
also offers better
performance so what should you know
before learning react
this this can vary depending on on
person to person but
generally you want to have a good handle
on javascript you don't want to go from
learning html and css and then jump
right into react
you should know all the fundamentals of
javascript including things like data
types variables
functions loops etc in react and
javascript in general you work with a
lot of asynchronous code
so you should be familiar with things
like promises array methods such as
for each map filter reduce these are all
commonly used in react applications
so get familiar with those doing
algorithms
that's a really good way to practice
these array methods
and then the fetch api is used to make
http requests
to either your own back-end server or to
a third-party api
for example the github or youtube api so
get familiar with fetch
again i have crash courses on most of
the stuff that you can check out if you
want
so as i said with react in pretty much
any front-end framework you're going to
be looking at your user interface as a
bunch of components
so here's the app we'll be building it's
called just called task tracker it's
pretty simple you just add a task
with a day and a time you can set a
reminder and you'll be able to double
click and
and set the reminder to either true or
false which will show this border
and we can delete and so on now over
here i just have outlined or created a
border around
each of the components so we have the
green around the header component
and inside the header we have a button
component we have the
add task component here which we could
actually break down even further and
create
input components as well if we wanted to
down here we have the tasks
component the purple which wraps around
all of these and then
each individual task is also its own
component
all right then we have down here the
footer component we're also going to
look at routing a little bit so we'll
have we have this about link
and that's going to go to a separate
route that will show the about component
all right so you can go to any website
or any ui
you go to twitter and and look at the
different components the list of tweets
each tweet itself the the box to post a
tweet
your all your followers everything can
be looked at as a component
so that's kind of the mind frame that
you want to be in when you're working
with react
or even angular view now as far as how
we create components in react
they can be created with both classes
and functions or functions i should say
now we'll be focusing mostly on function
components with hooks which seems to be
kind of
the more common way to do things these
days in my 2019
react crash course we focused on classes
so
if you really want to dive into into
class-based components you can check
that the older crash course out so on
the left we have a component called
header this is formatted as an arrow
function but
of course it could be a traditional
function as well it simply returns a div
with an
h1 now on the right is the same
component as a class
and you can see it's defined as a class
and it extends react.com
which is going to give us everything in
the in the the root component class to
work with
including the render method which takes
care of rendering it out on the screen
and in render we're just returning the
same thing we're returning here
now what's being returned looks like
html but it's actually just syntactic
sugar
for javascript which is called
javascript syntax extension or jsx
and it's similar to the html syntax
aside from a few things like instead of
the class attribute you have to use
class
name but in addition to that you can
also put any kind of javascript
expression
into your jsx to make it dynamic and
then once you have your component
created you can embed it into other
components with this type of syntax
which is similar to like xml
so we would just have header we can also
pass in props which are
basically attributes so we could pass in
a title of whatever we want
into the component and then work with it
inside of the
either the function or the class
whatever we're using
all right so components are not just
static markup they're dynamic and they
can
contain something called state so state
is basically just an object that
determines how a component renders and
behave
so an example would be if you have let's
say a collapsible menu
that would have an open and closed state
so you might have a state
object in your component that has a
value of open that could be either true
or false
now if you have a list of users or
tasks or whatever it might be that's
also part of the state so any data that
you bring into your components that's
going to be part of the state and a lot
of times you want to share that data
across
multiple components so in that case you
would use what's called
either app state or global state now
sometimes you end up having just a ton
of app level state that gets really
difficult to manage
so in that case you have a few options
you could use the context api which is
built into react
or you could use a third-party state
manager like redux
which is way beyond the scope of this
crash course but i did want to mention
it and i do have other videos on those
now prior to react version 16.8 we had
to use class components
if we wanted if we wanted to hold state
so
function components were actually called
dumb components because
they couldn't hold state however in
version 16.8
react introduced something called hooks
which allow us to
use state and other lifecycle functions
within function components
and that's what we'll be focusing on in
this crash course
specifically the use state hook which
allows us to return a stateful value
along with a function to update it
there's other hooks as well
use effect is used to perform side
effects in function components
we'll be using that towards the end um
one of the biggest uses for
use effect is to make http requests when
the page loads
so if you're fetching data from an api
on page load you'll want to use use
effect
there's a bunch of others as well
there's use context user reducer
but those are beyond the scope of this
crash course all right so if those last
few slides didn't really make much sense
at all don't worry about it because
we're going to
do we're going to have plenty of
examples throughout the course and
throughout this
application that we're going to build so
we're going to build out our user
interface first and then also implement
towards the end something called json
server
which we're going to use is kind of a
fake back end so you can see
how react would work if you were
building a full stack application and
making requests to a back end or an api
all right so enough with the slides
let's go ahead and jump in and let's get
started with react
all right so we're going to get started
now there's a bunch of ways to
basically start a react application one
of the most common
and easiest ways is using a program
called create react app which is a cli
it's a command line interface tool
to just easily get up and running and
set up a boilerplate with all the files
and folders and packages that you need
it also has a development server it has
a way to build out your static assets to
deploy
so to install this we need to use npm
which is the node package manager
and in order to use that you have to
have node.js installed on your system
i'm sure that a lot of you already do if
you don't just go to nodejs.org
download it install it doesn't matter if
you're on you know windows
mac or linux another thing i would
suggest installing is the react dev
tools if you're on chrome there's a
chrome extension there's a
firefox extension as well and it just
allows you to kind of see all the
components and props and state
of your react application so we're going
to install this
we're actually going to use the npx
command instead of installing it
globally with npm
what this does is it just runs create
react app and
creates the the folder for us rather
than installing create react app
on your system so first of all make sure
you have npm
you can do npm-version make sure it's
above 5.2 where you won't be able to use
npx
and then let's do npx create dash
react app and i'm going to call this
task dash actually let's call it
react dash task dash
tracker because i will be doing a vue.js
in angular course and we'll be doing the
same
application and this is just going to
set up
all of the files and folders that we
need it's going to install all the
packages that we need and so on
