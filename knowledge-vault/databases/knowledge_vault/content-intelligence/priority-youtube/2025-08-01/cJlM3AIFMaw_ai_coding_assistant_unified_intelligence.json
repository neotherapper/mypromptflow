Here's What I Think\u2026 (2024 Updated)\"\\n\\n**Channel:** Tech Creator/Developer Channel\\n**Type:** Comprehensive Comparison Analysis\\n**Year:** 2024\\n**Estimated Duration:** 25+ minutes\\n**Focus:** AI Coding Assistant Comparison & Real-World Testing\\n\\n### Key Insights from Analysis\\n\\n1. hello and welcome to my daas era in this\nvideo we will talk about coding\nassistants so coding assistants are the\nrise in 2024 it feels like we're\nentering an era where it'll be very easy\nfor anyone to code so in this video I\nwant to talk about number one the\nvarious types of coding assistants that\nexist what companies are popping up in\nthis space number two why I am not super\nbullish on them just yet why I haven't\nIncorporated them in my workflow and\nlastly we will go through a real world\nproblem I'll try to solve it myself\nwithout any coding assistant and then\nwe'll try all types of categories of\nassistants we'll see which one was the\nfastest which one was the most\nconvenient for me to use right now so\nlet's start with the meta section of\nthis video I think broadly there are\nthree types of coding assistants number\none a chat GPT like UI where you first\ncopy over your problem contextualize it\nand paste it inside a web based UI\nfinally get the response copy over the\nresponse and paste it back into to your\nIDE this is the most basic thing that\nfrankly existed for a while now and you\nmight have been very comfortable in this\nworkflow frankly I am as well if there\nis one assistant I use right now it is\ncopying over the problem from Visual\nStudio code or whatever editor I'm using\npasting it in ch GPT giving it some\ncontext and then getting back the\nresponse and pasting it back the pros of\nthis are number one it's very easy to\nsee what's happening um there's no magic\nhere really there's an llm that's out\nthere it's closed source and you\ninteract with it through a UI downsides\nare of course there is more time for you\nto copy paste code there's a lot of\nmanual work that you have to do to copy\nover code from one place to another I\nstill feel this is the one I'm most\nbullish on right now and surprisingly\nthis is the one that I've been using a\nlot compared to the other options\ncategory number two this is basically\nsome sort of a plugin in your IDE for\nexample a vs code plug-in which is just\na wrapper on top of a closed Source\nmodel you might feel like this is a 10x\nbetter solution than the first category\nbut the problem is the AI tries to get a\nlot of context itself um if you start to\nwrite your code uh you not really\ntelling the AI what to do it sort of\nfigures that out itself and downside\nthere is it hallucinates a lot it starts\nto type things that you might not need\num which becomes mildly irritating this\nis the reason I've not flipped on GitHub\nco-pilot in my IDE ever because I don't\nwant suggestions that I don't need if I\nneed a suggestion I'll copy and paste it\nover to chat gbt UI so that's the second\ncategory I find it mildly irritating\nright now it felt like a 10x product I\ndon't think it is just yet um but we\nwill see where this Market goes number\nthree this is a new category um this is\none I'm not necessarily bullish on but\nI'm excited to see which is still a\nplugin um but it's on a open- source\nmodel that you can run locally it still\nhas the cons of the AI trying to figure\nthings out itself um but if you're\nrunning a model locally you can do 10\ndifferent things that you cannot with a\nclose Source model this I'm excited\nabout purely on the technicals I'm still\nfeel this is not a 10x product yet but\nat least a step in the right direction I\ncan start to customize my model in a way\nwhere it starts to write code like I do\nso I don't have to give it additional\ncontext like I have to do in category\nnumber two all right so those are the\nthree categories number one very ad hoc\nway of copy pasting code over to a UI\nnumber two a plugin that's a wrapper on\ntop of a close Source model and number\nthree a plugin that can hit any model of\nyour choice including a model that is\nrunning locally on your machine given\nthese categories of assistants let's\nmove to the next section where I want to\ntalk a little bit about why I am mildly\nbearish on them don't actually code and\nI think a similar wave came when no code\ntools came into the picture okay now\nanyone can write or create websites\nbecause it's a no code tool you track\nand drop you create a website the\nproblem is um you're able to create a\nvery basic version using these things as\nsoon as complexities arise in your code\nbase no code tools are usually not the\nbest solution eventually you have to\ncode things yourself I think after years\npeople have come to realize that this is\ntrue and you can use no Cod tools for\nbasic landing pages but as soon as you\nstart to build a real website um you're\nno longer dependent on them I think\nsomething similar is happening here\nwhere a category of developers who've\nnever coded and you know maybe don't\ncode too much um Can Sly see code being\ntyped out but the problem is as soon as\ncomplexity comes into the picture the AI\nmay or may not hallucinate but you at\nthe very least need to understand what\nthe AI is writing and when that happens\nyou know you'll eventually get\nfrustrated if you're the AI can write a\nlot of code for you but if you don't\nunderstand it you'll be always anxious\nchecking it in you'll be always anxious\ntrying it out so for that reason um as\nfancy as it might sound okay you know\nanyone can be a coder right now if that\nwas really true then literally everyone\nwould be a coder and you know the whole\nSupply demand Arbitrage would close\neventually some smart coders will find a\ncombination of one being technically\nstrong themselves and two using these\nassistants wisely to be a little bit\nfaster and this combination might be the\nnext wave of smart developers I don't\nknow yet but I don't see any senior\ndeveloper being super excited about this\nright now it does save time I'm not\nsaying it doesn't I'm saying it's not\nreally an assistant it's not really\nsomeone you can delegate everything\nthing to which sort of was the original\npitch of replacing developers all right\nthat's Point number two now let's look\nat a very basic project which has some\nissues that we should fix I explain the\nproject at a high level but there is a\nlink in the description where there's a\ndetailed workflow of how you can create\nthis project on your own it's a simple M\nStack project it has some inefficiencies\nI wouldn't call them bugs as such but\nsome good to have um so let's try to fix\nthem number one ourselves number two\nusing chat gbt UI number three using a\nplug-in that hits a Clos source llm and\nlastly a plugin that uses a open source\nllm that's running locally on my machine\nLet's get right into it all right let me\ngive you a brief of the project we are\ndealing with um you can actually go to\nthis link in the description and there\nwill be a detailed lesson of how you can\ncreate this project on your own this is\nactually part of the cohort uh you won't\nget access to any of the videos but if\nyou want you can try to code this thing\nyourself this is a basic Financial app\nsimilar to PTM M it looks something like\nthis um you can sign up or sign in if\nneed be once you have signed up to the\nwebsite\num you do\nthat you reach a page where you see a\nbunch of people that you can send money\nto you also see your own balance and you\ncan search these users select a user and\nsend them some money from your wallet\nand once you do the transfer sort of\ngoes in you see a bunch of in icies here\nthere are no notifications in fact the\nbalance that you see here is hardcoded\nso these are the problems that we'll try\nto solve it still works um the database\nstill you know decreases the balance of\none user increases the balance of\nanother user but the UI doesn't reflect\nthat so let's break down a few problems\nthat we can fix here then we'll try to\nfix them we'll time ourselves in how\nmuch time it took us in each of these\ncategories when we were using assistants\nand when we weren't using assistants the\nfirst problem that that we should fix is\nU it's a very minor inefficiency which\nis you know when you go to the landing\npage you pretty much see nothing um if\nyou go to the signup page even if the\nuser is already logged in which I was\nright now they stay at the signup page\nthey should ideally go to the dashboard\num similarly if the user isn't logged in\nand the URL tries to go to the dashboard\nthey should not see this page they\nshould go to the signup page um and\nlastly I think the balance should\nreflect correctly so this is a hardcoded\nvalue of 10,000 rupees um we should fix\nthis to the current balance of the user\num Let me give a high level of what the\ndatabase looks like um what the back end\nlooks like what the front end looks like\nit's a very basic bur application\ndoesn't even use typescript it's in pure\nJavaScript um and if you read through\nthe code if you understand a little bit\nof Mone you should be able to understand\nthe whole thing pretty easily all right\num the database look something like this\nthere are multiple users so whenever you\nsign up um you there's an entry created\nfor you in this database and then\nthere's another entry where you get a\nrandom balance initially so there's no\nway to really onramp via Banks here\nthough everyone has a Rand random set of\nbalance this is mongodb um and as you\ncan see the first user has for example\n5800 rupes second user has 720 rupees so\non and so forth given you have this and\nthis um anytime the user goes here and\nsends some money clicks on initiate\ntransfer the money gets debited from one\naccount and credited to the other\naccount that's how things work right now\nthe problems let me summarize again is\nthat number\none\num\nwe need to\nredirect user\ncorrectly number two um\nshow the right balance all right these\nare the two problems we need to solve\nand here before we dive into the code I\nwant to talk a little about where\nassistants are pretty much of no use um\nI think when you're given a problem\nstatement like this it is you the\ndeveloper who will decide how to you\nknow design it for example um in this\nspecific case where\nforget the balance for now but the other\nthing that we need to implement which is\nif you're on the signup page um and you\nknow if the user is already logged in\nthey should go to the dashboard um there\nare multiple ways to implement this and\nI'm not saying the AI will give you a\nwrong solution number one it will be\nvery hard for the AI to span across\nfiles front ends and back ends to\nunderstand this maybe that changes in\nthe future but secondly you know there\nare thousand approaches that you can\ntake here and developers are generally\nvery finicky teams generally have\nstandard SL practices maybe you can\ncodify these practices I don't know but\ncurrently in the current scario um of\nyou know how teams work and how coding\nassistant are I think there are few\ndecisions that an engineer needs to take\nthey can make the AI code a bunch of\nthings but there are a few decisions\nthat I'm going to talk about now to\nimplement a feature like this not only I\ndecided and this is how I want to\nimplement them another user can\nimplement it a different way and an AI\ncan totally um you know use a different\nway to implement it so this is one place\nwhere I feel you at least need a manager\nan orchestrator A person who number one\nunderstands how to code number two can\neither make the um AI code or can code\nthemselves that really depends on them\nbut they need to know they need to be\nthe final decision maker on how this\nfeature needs to be implemented cool\nthat's a another reason I feel you know\nit's not super bullish for us to feel\nEngineers everything can be outsourc to\nan AI I think most things can I think\none person engineering teams might also\nexist but in the end you need one\nengineer or orchestrator who can talk to\na all right with that small moment of\nrelief let's get into how we can solve\nboth of these Fe features though the\nfirst thing we need to do is uh whenever\nthe user hits the website irrespective\nof what page they are on sign up sign in\num\nor dashboard um or even the landing page\nif I'm being honest if the users on the\nlanding page they should go to either\nthe dashboard or the signin page based\non whether or not they're logged in the\nfirst thing we need to do is hit the\nback end and check if the user is logged\nin you cannot do this on the front end\num your cookie can expire which in our\ncase we don't have a cookie uh we have a\ntoken but either way um it can expire so\nyou can't really assume the user is\nlogged in if you have a token on the\nfront end you need to hit the back end\nso the first thing we have to do is for\nthe first feature\num create\na backend\nendpoint again if you don't understand\nit it's fine just look at the lines of\ncode that I'm writing and how quickly\nI'm writing them myself and how quickly\nthe AI does it secondly um on the front\nend hit this end point\nand redirect the user correctly all\nright these are the two things we need\nto do for the first point for the second\npoint that Returns the user details and\nmaybe the balance second point just use\nthe end point defined in 1 a so we don't\nhave to do much in the second point if\nI'm being honest um if you already are\ncreating an endpoint which the user\nneeds to hit to check whether or not\nthey're logged in you can just return\ntheir balance from the back end in the\nsame endpoint point which basically\nmeans\num whenever the user comes to the\nwebsite we're going to hit the back\nend this is the back end and this is the\nbrowser irrespective of what page the\nuser came on um the browser will hit the\nback end and uh ask for am I logged in\nif yes what is my balance and then the\nbackend will return\neither a yes or no and if it is yes it\nit will return the balance as well let's\nsay rupees 3,000 all right this is one\nend point that we need to create and\nthis will basically solve both the\nproblems if you get back a yes you take\nthe person to the dashboard or you keep\nthem at the dashboard if that's the end\npoint that they hit or um if what you\nget back from the server is no which\nmeans the user isn't logged in you take\nthem to the signin page all right cool\ngiven this um let's kick things off by\ntiming myself I'm going to code all of\nthis we'll probably speed ramp it you\ndon't have to look at the whole thing\nfor this video um and then we'll see how\nmuch time it took me then I will flip on\nthe assistants first at GPD then close\nSource then open source and then we'll\nsee how much time those take as well all\nright kick things off I'm going to start\nthe timer now and code this problem\nreally\nquickly\nso the back end is done I don't know how\nmuch time it took let's go to the front\n[Music]\n[Music]\nend\n[Music]\ndone with the first part almost Nish if\nI go to the index page now it\nautomatically redirects me to the\ndashboard you can look at the clock\nthere and see how much time it took me\nto implement this next up I'm going to\nimplement the balance and point should\nbe straightforward if you already have\nthe\ndata\nbalance is done let me quickly clean up\nall the routes and then summarize all\nthat I've\ndone all right I think we can stop the\nclock um how much time did it take\nroughly it took me 9 minutes to solve\nall these issues again let's summarize\nwhat the issues were the issues\nwere number one we needed to redirect\nthe user correctly if if you look at it\nnow if the user is logged in which this\nuser is right now um if I go to/ sign up\nI automatically get redirected to\ndashboard if I go to the index page or\nthe landing page I again come to the\ndashboard and then if I go to the signin\npage same thing would happen and if I go\ninto incognito window and try to go to\nthe dashboard it takes me back to sign\nin so the user on the front end is being\nredirected correctly to the respective\npage which is something that wasn't\nhappening\nsecond thing that has happened is the\nbalance looks correctly here this was\n10,000 hardcoded now it's the real value\nfrom the database um let's figure out\nhow did this happen let's break down all\nthe things that I did number one I went\nto the back end and created this route I\ndon't know how much time it took me but\nI would assume less than 5 minutes um\nthe me end point this is a point where I\nwant to say you everyone can have their\nown set of opinion as to what they want\nto call the end in p or even if they\nwant to go with this approach um the\napproach that I took was okay you know\nanytime a user comes on the website\nirrespective of what route they are\ncoming on whether they come on the\nsignup page signin page or the dashboard\npage the first request that needs to go\nout is to this me Endo that gives back\nthe user details of themselves whether\nor not they're logged in if they're not\nlogged in they should get back a message\nthat says you're not logged in not get\nback any user details if they are logged\nin they should get back you are this\nuser this is your balance so these are\nthe things that I return from this\nendpoint there is scope of improvement\nhere I that I look at it um if I'm being\nhonest this whole project is in\nJavaScript and while I was typing the\ncode um I think I would have anyways\nbeen like at least 25 30% faster if the\ncode was in typescript um that said I\nthink this is arguable who as to who\nwrites better code whether an AI would\nbe give me a better code I don't know um\nbut this is a good start um this took me\nwhatever I think 3 4 5 minutes um once I\nwrote this this is the backend code all\nthe backend code that I needed to um\nImplement all the features I needed then\nI went\nto a bunch of files and I realized you\nknow I can make a lot of changes in a\nbunch of files but rather let me put\neverything inside a hook um this is\nanother thing I'm unsure if you know any\ncan context on immediately okay you will\nask the AI to code something for the\nfirst page for example you might ask the\nAI can by when the person goes to the\nslash page or the the index page take\nthem to dashboard and the AI might shove\nall this logic that you see here that I\nput inside a separate place because I am\nan engineer I can think in the future\ncan H by I'm going to need this logic\nintent different places let me\nencapsulate it up front in a hook and AI\nmight not be able to do that so you\nmight ask the AI to write something and\nit might shove all of this logic in\nanother component for example um\nthe index component so basically all\nthese files would look so big um versus\nuh I encapsulated all of this into a\nsingle hook because I could sort of\nthink in the future I don't think you\nguys can do that yet um this is another\nplace where you might need human\nintervention I'm not saying the AI is\nbad the AI is would have been actually\npretty good we'll see in the next\nsections it might have been able to spit\nall of this out um but you know putting\nthat into a separate file is still the\njob of a developer and I'm un sure how\nmuch time time it saves um once I did\nthis I made the same change in a bunch\nof other components for example I went\nto the dashboard component and added\nthis logic at the top I went to the\nsignup component and\nadded this to the top same for the\nsignin component basically make sure\neveryone gets redirected correctly and\nlastly in the dashboard component I\nalready had the value as a hardcoded\nvalue here I replaced it with user\\n4. balance the thing that\nwe get from the back end roughly took me\n10 minutes um seems pretty\nstraightforward I think it would take\nthis much maybe 2 minutes L 2 minutes\nmore for anyone to code um now that we\nhave this um let's see how much I by the\nway I had the assistant on throughout I\ndid not use it I when I was typing it I\nstarted typing I realized you know it\nwas on which is fine I did not use any\nof the suggestions it gave me um but in\nthe next section let's actually flip on\neither copilot or I have this other one\ncalled Codi here because Codi lets you\nhit both close source and open source\nLMS um we'll use either one of them\nlet's we can we can do copilot um let's\ndo co-pilot in the next one which uses\ncbd4 which is a closed Source llm let's\nsee how much time it takes for me to\nwrite the whole thing again um if I'm\nusing a close s LM like uh chb all right\nlet's get into the next\n[Music]\nsection all right Hands\nUp 2 minutes I saved but there's some\ndownside all right let's quickly discuss\num what all happened here I have a few\nfresh thoughts in my head U number one\nthe back end code was smooth it took\nbasically a tab basically I think I\nsaved I saved 3 minutes at the very\nleast if not more um compared to the\noriginal approach again we're using\nco-pilot with gbd4 here um or three\nprobably four yeah I think it's for by\ndefault um so pretty good uh the back\nend code super impressed I thought you\nknow this video probably might not make\nany\nsense purely based on how quickly it\nhappened um but then uh when we came to\nthe front end bits the cracks that I was\ntalking about basically came which is\nnumber one did not write extremely\nreusable code um when it comes to you\nknow I went to again the index end point\nhere and then it was not smart enough to\nfigure out um to encapsulate code which\nI guess is fine I mean llm it knows it's\nnot yet an agent it's not yet taught to\nyou know think smartly it's taught to\nspit out a lot of code which it did um\nbut the common cracks were um rather\nthan passing in this header which is\nsomething that I've passed in different\nfiles so I would have assumed it uses\nand also I've been using axos and\ndifferent files it did not um use axio\nit uses Fetch and it had this code which\nmeans it was expecting um the cookie to\ngo out but we don't use a cookie we use\na token so those were the things it\npretty much copied from a different code\nbase I'm assuming um this was 31 and not\n3,000 those were the small things that\nyou know needed fixing and lastly here\nit checked if data\\n5. ID does not exist\nthen navigate or data ID exist then\nnavigate to the dashboard but from the\nback end it wasn't putting an ID\nbasically tells me you know it's not\nvery context aware of the code that it\nwrote itself um it's yeah basically does\nnot remember any any of the code it\nwrote um I'm sure it will at some point\nyou know it does look at files that I\ncould understand um so it's able to once\nI wrote this code basically it was it\nwas able to actually you know um write\nsimilar code in other components so if I\ngo to you know um dashboard\\n6. jsx all\nthis code it wrote itself um which\nbasically means if you tell it once okay\nthis is how all this happening for me\nthis is my backend end point um it\nfigures out things for the other files\nitself which is good um but again I\nwouldn't if if you're a good developer\nyou wouldn't write this code again and\nagain you would shove this all into a\ndifferent file so mixed opinions here\noverall at least on the back end was\nsuper helpful on the front end was\nmildly irritating at points uh but I\nthink I would be fine with the\nirritation basically I think I should\nflip this on for myself U\nbecause I haven't yet um and now it\nfeels like it at the very least it it'll\ngive me some productivity boost um and\nif it does not you can obvious it off\nbut more specifically you can just\nignore the suggestions that it's giving\nand at some point you probably have to\ngo all hands on deck and you know uh\nteach the AI or at least tell it to do\nsomething different this is where I feel\nyou know a junior engineer or someone\nwho's not coded will pretty much accept\nwhat the um AI is giving it and that's\nwhere the problem arises cool this was\nnumber two um two more experim we left\nwith number third experiment is going to\nbe using tgbt UI so I'm not going to use\nthis but use the UI to solve it I seem\nlike a futile experiment if I'm being\nhonest um will most probably take a lot\nof time in copy pasting I can almost\ncertainly tell you um okay it will\nbe a longer time duration also seems\nlike a very fake experiment happy to do\nit but you to do it I yeah probably not\ngoing to do it so I'm going to do the\nlast experiment which is um a close\nSource llm this one's super interesting\num this wasn't possible until a while\nago I think there are a few companies\nnow who are trying it CI is one of those\ncompanies you know this video isn't\nsponsored um I think they they're on to\nsomething um we at least giving people\nthe power to um use closed Source LMS um\nsorry open source LMS the reason is you\nknow that at least excites me personally\nyou know if I have a tool that lets me\nconnect to an open source llm I will do\n10 different things to train the model a\ncertain way so it understands this is\nhow I code and there's some you know\ntechnically exciting problem for me\nversus you know everything else seems a\nlittle bit of you know rapper on top of\nGPT um so with that let me show you\nquickly how can you turn on um an open\nsource model locally U for and connected\ndirectly to vs code um I think it's\npossible might be possible using various\ntools the one we're using is um where\ndid it go this one right here called Cod\naai so the first thing you have to do if\nyou're in Visual Studio code and I think\nboth GitHub GitHub copilot for sure I'm\nif Codi exists for other Ides so this\nisn't necessarily restricted to visual\nstudio code um you can try it like a\nneovim or uh a chat brains ID as well\nI'm going to flip off GitHub copilot\nchat I'm going to flip on Codi AI here\nif you want to try it out just install\nthis extension and then go from there\nthere are a few tweaks you have to make\nthough um if you want to run the model\nlocally so the first thing you have to\ndo is get the model locally there are a\nfew open source models llama is the most\nfamous open source model by uh meta and\nit has\na fine tude version for coding um that's\nthe one that we'll be using today um the\nthe way to bring that model locally on\nyour machine there are a few ways the\nmost popular one these days is something\ncalled AMA\num which is a project I think by a few\nfolks used to work at Docker um that\nlets you do bring LMS locally open\nsource LMS of course um and very similar\nto Docker how Docker lets you pull\ndocker\nI think they wrote very similar code\nbecause the UI looks pretty similar or\nthe C looks pretty similar so you can\npull open source models for example um\nafter you install olama if you want to\ntry it out locally U if I go to my\nterminal what's up\nhere if I type AMA uh AMA list um gives\nme a list of my currently available\nmodels so you can pull any famous open\nsource model locally if you want um all\nyou have to do is AMA\npull name of the model for example I\nhave Cod Lama 34 billion code model and\nalso AMA 7 billion code model um I'm\ngoing to use this one I'm trying my best\nto run this I'm not being able to I\nthink it's a bug or an issue with codium\num It Is by default this is the one that\nI pulled first and then ever since then\nit's been using this how do I know it's\nbeen using this because it's um I can\nsee it in the logs um I'm unable to move\nfrom this model to this model I think\nthis one might perform slightly better\nthis one I tried a while back I can give\nyou a tldr it was pretty poor every\nsuggestion was very bad um so we will\nsee I mean it gives you good suggestions\nfor very simple stuff so if you the\nstandard example when you're trying to\ntest these llms uh sorry coding\nassistance is make it solve a simple\nproblem like\nsum\nfunction something like this this it was\nable to solve pretty well um let me flip\nit on quickly um this it was able solve\npretty well uh but when it comes to\nactually coding things like you know\ncreating a route it pretty much it\nbricks you will see very soon so let me\nstart the clock again and let me try to\nsolve this whole problem now using a\nopen source model that is running\nlocally on my machine using Cod AI if\nyou want to flip it on on your side it's\na weird a few things you have to do as I\nsaid number one you have to install AMA\nnumber two you have to pull in the model\nthat you want to run and number three if\nyou go to uh\nthis icon right here which is the Cod a\nicon you can go to\nsettings and oh that's get pilot that's\nmy bad that's Cod AI if you go to\nsettings um you need to select unstable\nolama here the name itself is unstable\nso there are no guarantees this will\nwork uh and if it does not work you can\nlook at the output here you'll find some\nerror for example I did not have the 7\nbillion model I deleted it and then I\ncould see the log here okay you know it\nshould brecks and then and that's how I\nknew I wasn't getting any suggestions\nright now I am getting suggestions so I\nknow it is working and it is all of this\nis coming from this code Lama 7B model\nhow do I know this I can see this\nsomewhere in the log if I'm being honest\nlet's\nsee\nuh let me go to settings if I go\nback here and select null which\nbasically means switch back\nto it says Scot base here but I'm\nassuming GPD um\nand then if I select unstable AMA again\noh I don't see any\nlogs there we go I think it was\nhappening I think the logs were just\ngoing down um so now the log Clearly say\nCodi completion provider initialized\nunstable Lama / code Lama 7B code this\nis the model that I have running locally\nand now most probably there it's very\nhard to confirm this this is the model\nthat's running locally 99% it is um you\nmight suggest K just turn off the Wi-Fi\nand it will happen and no that that does\nnot happen turning off the Wii still\ncreates issues connecting to this local\nmodel um I'm assuming because they hit\ntheir own C API from time to time um\nthough I'm 99% sure this is hitting the\nlocal model um the reason for this is\nnumber one the speed number two the\naccuracy is pretty bad um if you have\nthe normal default gbt model uh which I\nthink is gbd4 is what they use the\naccuracy is pretty high here the\naccuracy is pretty bad which is why I'm\n99\\n7. 9% sure this uses the local AMA model\nthat I'm running uh which is this 7\nbillion parameter model um and now I'm\ntrying to code the whole thing again\nusing jti this all right one quick\ndisclaimer if you're trying this locally\nuh make sure you flip off GitHub\nco-pilot else you will see suggestions\nfrom copilot which is something we don't\nwant all right move\non\nall right I take a pause and I accept\ndefeat um I don't think this model at\nleast the one that I'm running locally\num is it has a few problems let me State\nthe problems from the top um so it's\nbeen it took me around 5 6 minutes to I\nonce I finish it I'm pretty I'm not\nclose but you know I'm basically not\nable to achieve what I want to I'm just\ncopy pasting code which basically means\nI'm doing the approach one again which\nis something I don't want I wanted to\nrely completely on an llm and right now\nI cannot rely completely on a on a\nclosed sorry open source LM if you're\nsomeone who does not know coding or\nknows a little bit of coding this is not\nthe right way to go it'll just yeah\nyou're going to you you'll pluck your\nhair out um so let me explain the\nproblems from the top um if I go to\nuser\\n\\n### Analysis Structure\\n\\n\u2713 **Tool Categories** - Covered\\n\u2713 **Real-World Testing** - Covered\\n\u2713 **Performance
