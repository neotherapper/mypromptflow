## Intelligent Tagging Logic

### Pattern Matching Engine

#### High-Confidence Name Patterns (90%+ Accuracy)
```yaml
Docker MCP Server:
  - Pattern: "(?i)\\bdocker\\b"
  - Tags: ["docker", "developer-tools", "deployment"]
  - Company: ["docker"]
  - Knowledge Links: ["container-technology", "deployment-automation"]
  - Confidence: 0.95

Microsoft Teams MCP Server:
  - Pattern: "(?i)microsoft|\\bteams\\b"
  - Tags: ["communication", "collaboration", "enterprise"]
  - Company: ["microsoft"]
  - Knowledge Links: ["team-communication", "microsoft-ecosystem"]
  - Confidence: 0.92
```

#### Context-Aware Enhancement
- **Business Score Integration**: Tier 1 servers get "enterprise" + "high-priority" tags
- **Community Adoption Signals**: High adoption servers get "popular" + "ecosystem" tags
- **Information Retrieval Relevance**: High IR servers get "information-retrieval" + "search" tags

### Relationship Generation

#### Semantic Similarity Matching
- **Knowledge Base Search**: Full-text search across all knowledge items
- **Category Mapping**: Predefined technology → knowledge category relationships
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multiple criteria weighted combination
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Minimum 0.65 confidence for auto-linking

#### Cross-Reference Format
- **Forward Reference**: MCP Profile → `@knowledge_vault/{item_uuid}`
- **Reverse Reference**: Knowledge Item → `@mcp_profile/{server-name}`
- **Validation**: Ensures both referenced items exist
- **Metadata**: Relationship type, confidence score, creation timestamp
