  # Deprecated Terms (Avoid These)
  examine: "Replace with assess or evaluate"

  cohesion: "Degree of relatedness within a component"
  abstraction: "Hiding implementation details behind interface"

### Quality & Testing Standards
# Unified quality-related terminology
quality_testing_standards:
  # Quality Levels
  standard: "Established quality requirement or guideline"
  criterion: "Specific quality measurement point"
  requirement: "Mandatory quality specification"
  guideline: "Recommended quality practice"
  
  # Testing Types
  unit_test: "Test of individual component in isolation"
  integration_test: "Test of component interactions"
  system_test: "Test of complete system functionality"
  acceptance_test: "Test of business requirement fulfillment"
  
  # Testing Activities
  test_case: "Specific test scenario with expected outcome"
  test_suite: "Collection of related test cases"
  test_execution: "Process of running tests"
  test_coverage: "Percentage of code exercised by tests"

## Context-Specific Standards

### React Context Terminology
react_specific_terms:
  # Component Lifecycle
  render: "Process of generating virtual DOM representation"
  mount: "Initial creation and insertion of component into DOM"
  update: "Re-rendering due to props or state changes"
  unmount: "Removal of component from DOM"
  
  # State Management
  state: "Component's internal data that can change"
  props: "External data passed to component"
  context: "Shared state accessible across component tree"
  reducer: "Function that processes state changes"
  
  # Performance
  memoization: "Caching technique to prevent unnecessary re-renders"
  optimization: "Improvement of performance characteristics"
  profiling: "Analysis of performance bottlenecks"

### Testing Context Terminology
testing_specific_terms:
  # Test Classifications
  functional_test: "Test that verifies business logic correctness"
  non_functional_test: "Test that verifies quality attributes"
  regression_test: "Test that verifies existing functionality after changes"
  smoke_test: "Basic test to verify system is operational"
  
  # Security Testing
  vulnerability_assessment: "Process of identifying security weaknesses"
  penetration_test: "Simulated attack to test security defenses"
  security_scan: "Automated analysis of security issues"
  threat_modeling: "Systematic analysis of potential security threats"

### TypeScript Context Terminology
typescript_specific_terms:
  # Type System
  type: "Definition of data structure and constraints"
  interface: "Contract defining object shape"
  generic: "Type parameter that provides flexibility"
  constraint: "Restriction on generic type parameters"
  
  # Compilation
  transpilation: "Conversion from TypeScript to JavaScript"
  type_checking: "Verification of type correctness"
  compilation: "Complete build process including type checking"
  emit: "Generation of JavaScript output files"

## Implementation Guidelines

### Usage Rules
usage_rules:
  consistency: "Use the same term for the same concept across all contexts"
  precision: "Choose the most specific appropriate term"
  clarity: "Prefer terms that clearly communicate intent"
  standardization: "Follow established industry conventions where applicable"

### Cross-Reference Patterns
cross_reference_patterns:
  # When referring to concepts from other contexts
  context_qualification: "Use 'performance assessment' not 'performance validation'"
  domain_specificity: "Use domain-specific terms within their proper context"
  interface_standardization: "Use standard terms at context boundaries"

### Migration Strategy
migration_strategy:
  # How to transition existing content
  phase_1: "Create vocabulary guide and identify inconsistencies"
  phase_2: "Update high-impact files with standardized terminology"
  phase_3: "Validate improved coherence through framework assessment"
  phase_4: "Monitor and maintain consistency in new content"

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Criteria
validation_criteria:
  terminology_consistency: "Same concepts use same terms across contexts"
  domain_appropriateness: "Terms are appropriate for their technical domain"
  clarity_improvement: "Terminology enhances rather than obscures meaning"
  framework_coherence: "Improved cohesion between related concepts"

### Success Metrics
success_metrics:
  framework_coherence_score: "Target: 85+ (from current 79)"
  terminology_standardization: "95%+ consistent usage of preferred terms"
  cross_reference_accuracy: "100% valid and accessible file paths"
  documentation_clarity: "Improved readability and comprehension"
