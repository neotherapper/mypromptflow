capacity_calculation:
  base_calculation:
    sprint_length: 10  # 2-week sprints (10 working days)
    hours_per_day: 8
    total_hours_per_person: 80

    Context Switching = Available Hours × 0.10
    Buffer = Available Hours × 0.15
    Effective Capacity = Available Hours - Meeting Overhead - Context Switching - Buffer
```

### 2. Skill-Based Task Assignment
