## JIRA Local Management System Integration

### System Overview

**JIRA Access**: This project has access to VanguardAI JIRA context via symlinked `.jira/` directory
**Integration Method**: Local cache system with real-time MCP JIRA operations
**Context Loading**: Automatic detection and loading of VanguardAI project context

### JIRA System Workflow

**Before JIRA Operations**:
1. **Check JIRA System Availability**: Verify `.jira/` directory exists (symlinked or local)
2. **Load Project Context**: Read `.jira/contexts/project-context.yaml` for VanguardAI settings
3. **Review Cache Data**: Check `.jira/cache/` for current project status and epic information
4. **Select Templates**: Use appropriate templates from `.jira/templates/`

**Story Creation Process**:
```yaml
jira_story_creation:
  step_1_context_loading:
    - "Read .jira/contexts/project-context.yaml for VanguardAI context"
    - "Load maritime insurance domain knowledge and tech stack info"
    - "Identify current epic (SCRUM-41) and project structure"
  
  step_2_requirements_processing:
    - "Analyze natural language requirements using maritime insurance context"
    - "Apply VanguardAI team structure and role assignments"
    - "Generate story using maritime-story-template.json"
  
  step_3_jira_creation:
    - "Use MCP JIRA tools to create story with proper VanguardAI context"
    - "Link to SCRUM-41 epic automatically"
    - "Apply maritime-domain labels and appropriate components"
    - "Set story points based on complexity assessment"
  
  step_4_cache_update:
    - "Update .jira/cache/stories/ with new story information"
    - "Log operation in .jira/sync/sync-log.md"
    - "Update epic story count and project status"
```

**Context Awareness**:
```yaml
vanguardai_context:
  domain: "maritime_insurance"
  tech_stack: ["React", "TypeScript", "FastAPI", "Python", "PostgreSQL"]
  jira_project: "SCRUM"
  current_epic: "SCRUM-41"
  epic_title: "AI-Powered Development Infrastructure & Automation"
  team_roles: ["Head of Engineering", "Lead Frontend", "Lead Backend", "UI/UX Designer"]
  
  story_patterns:
    labels: ["ai-agents", "productivity", "maritime-domain", "automation"]
    components: ["AI Infrastructure", "Development Tools", "Documentation"]
    default_assignee: "Unassigned"
    epic_linking: "SCRUM-41"
```

### MCP JIRA Tools Usage

**Story Creation**:
```python
# Use mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_create_issue with VanguardAI context
{
  "project_key": "SCRUM",
  "summary": "AI-generated story title with maritime context",
  "issue_type": "Story", 
  "description": "Maritime insurance specific user story with acceptance criteria",
  "additional_fields": {
    "parent": {"key": "SCRUM-41"},
    "labels": ["ai-agents", "maritime-domain", "productivity"],
    "customfield_10016": 5  # Story points
  }
}
```

**Story Updates and Management**:
- **Search Stories**: Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_search` with VanguardAI project context
- **Get Story Details**: Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_get_issue` for current story status
- **Update Stories**: Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_update_issue` for story modifications
- **Transition Stories**: Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_get_transitions` and `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_transition_issue`

### Error Handling and Learning

**JIRA MCP Error Integration**:
- **Pre-operation**: Check `@meta/mcp-learning/usage-guides/jira-guide.md` for known patterns
- **Error Logging**: Log JIRA errors to MCP learning system when available
- **Success Documentation**: Update usage guides with working patterns
- **Fallback Strategy**: Provide detailed specifications for manual JIRA creation if MCP fails

**Cache Management**:
- **Sync Status**: Monitor `.jira/sync/sync-status.json` for system health
- **Data Freshness**: Check cache timestamps and refresh when needed
- **Validation**: Ensure cache data consistency with live JIRA data
