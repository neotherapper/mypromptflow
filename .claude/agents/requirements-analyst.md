```

### 2. User Story Creation Framework

**User Story Template**:
```
As a [user type/persona]
I want [functionality/capability]
So that [business value/outcome]

Acceptance Criteria:

- When [user action/trigger]
- Then [expected result/behavior]

Definition of Done:
- [ ] Functional requirements implemented
