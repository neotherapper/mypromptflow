## Multi-Level Validation Framework

### Level 1: Individual Instruction Assessment (Weight: 25%)
**Concreteness Framework (0-5 scoring)**:
- **Specificity** (25%): Concrete parameters vs. vague qualifiers

- **Precision** (10%): Exact values vs. approximate ranges
- **Thresholds** (10%): Defined limits vs. undefined boundaries

**Assessment Formula**:
```
Concreteness Score = (Specificity × 0.25) + (Measurability × 0.20) + 
                    (Actionability × 0.20) + (Dependency × 0.15) + 
                    (Precision × 0.10) + (Thresholds × 0.10)
```

- Quantity vagueness: "several", "some", "many", "various", "appropriate"

## Assessment Execution Process

### Step 1: Detection and Classification (1 minute)
1. **Detect AI Instruction Type**: Apply location and content-based detection patterns
2. **Classify Instruction Category**: Determine Type 1-4 classification for appropriate assessment
3. **Read Target File**: Load and parse the AI agent instruction file completely
4. **Apply Framework Selector**: Determine which frameworks apply using pattern detection
5. **Load Required Contexts**: Progressive context loading for relevant framework modules
6. **Document Methodology**: Record detection results, classification, and assessment approach

### Step 2: Multi-Tool Assessment Execution (5-6 minutes)
1. **Execute Assessment Tools**: Run comprehensive assessment with error handling
2. **Apply Framework Checklists**: Use documented checklists for each applicable framework
3. **Calculate Component Scores**: Apply scoring formulas with documented weightings
4. **Document Findings**: Record specific file references, line numbers, and evidence

### Step 3: Multi-Level Validation (1-2 minutes)
1. **Level 1-5 Assessment**: Apply each validation level with proper weightings
2. **Cross-Level Validation**: Verify consistency across validation levels
3. **Constitutional AI Check**: Ensure ethical compliance across all instructions
4. **Calculate Overall Score**: Use documented formula for final effectiveness score

### Step 4: Recommendations and Reporting (30 seconds)
1. **Generate Specific Recommendations**: Provide actionable improvement suggestions
2. **Create Assessment Report**: Structured output with all findings and calculations
3. **Document Time and Methodology**: Record actual time taken and tools used
4. **Validate Assessment Quality**: Ensure assessment meets quality control standards

## Quality Thresholds and Scoring

### Overall Effectiveness Calculation
```
Overall Score = (Level_1 × 0.25) + (Level_2 × 0.20) + (Level_3 × 0.20) + 
               (Level_4 × 0.20) + (Level_5 × 0.15)

Scale: 0-100 points
```

### Quality Thresholds
- **Production Ready** (90-100): Excellent implementation meeting all standards
- **Near Production** (80-89): Good implementation with minor improvements needed
- **Acceptable** (70-79): Functional with moderate improvements required
- **Needs Work** (60-69): Significant issues requiring attention
- **Unacceptable** (<60): Major problems preventing production use

### Framework-Specific Minimum Requirements
- **Concreteness Score**: Minimum 4.0/5.0 (80%)
- **Self-Sufficiency Score**: Minimum 4.0/5.0 (80%)
- **Actionable Score**: Minimum 4.0/5.0 (80%)
- **Purpose-Driven Score**: Minimum 3.6/5.0 (72%)
