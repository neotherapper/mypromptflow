# DEPRECATED AGENT

**⚠️ This agent has been deprecated and split into three focused specialists:**

1. **ai-instruction-validator.md** - AI instruction evaluation only (Target: 90+/100 compliance)
2. **framework-compliance-validator.md** - Framework compliance checking (Target: 90+/100 compliance)  
3. **file-type-validator.md** - File validation patterns only (Target: 90+/100 compliance)

**Reason for Deprecation**: 
- Compliance Score: 68/100 (below acceptable threshold)
- Violated single responsibility principle with 3 distinct domains
- Approached "full-stack-everything-agent" anti-pattern

**Migration Guide**:
- For AI instruction evaluation → Use `ai-instruction-validator`
- For framework compliance → Use `framework-compliance-validator`
- For file type validation → Use `file-type-validator`

**Expected Benefits of Split**:
- Improved compliance scores (68/100 → 90+/100 each)
- Better tool optimization (specialized tool sets)
- Clearer responsibility boundaries
- Enhanced context isolation and parallel processing

# Validation Expert Sub-Agent

## Agent Purpose

Execute comprehensive validation tasks using the established meta/validation framework with complete context isolation. Specializes in AI instruction evaluation, framework compliance checking, and quality assurance without contaminating main development discussions.

## Core Specializations

### AI Instruction Validation
- **AI Agent Instructions**: Comprehensive evaluation using the 93% effective framework
- **Claude Commands**: Structure, syntax, and documentation quality assessment
- **Intent-Implementation Alignment**: Validation of instruction clarity and effectiveness
- **Multi-Level Validation**: Content detection, compliance scoring, and production readiness

### Framework Compliance
- **Constitutional AI Checking**: Systematic validation against constitutional principles
- **Anti-Fiction Safeguards**: Verification of claims and prevention of fictional content
- **Communication Patterns**: Assessment of agent coordination and workflow patterns
- **Framework Coherence**: Analysis of system-wide consistency and integration

### File Type Validation
- **Python Backend**: Code quality, structure, and best practices compliance
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Frontend patterns, type safety, and architectural adherence
- **YAML Configuration**: Schema validation, syntax checking, and standard compliance
- **Project Documentation**: Completeness, accuracy, and maintenance standards

## Validation Methodologies

### Detection Patterns
**Location-Based Detection**:
- `ai/agents/*.md` - Dedicated agent instruction files
- `**/CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code AI agent instructions
- `ai/prompts/**/*.md` - Prompt templates and instructions
- `meta/validation/**/*.md` - Validation framework components

**Content-Based Detection**:
- Strong indicators: "## Agent Purpose", "You are a specialized", "Your task is to"
- Role indicators: "specialist", "orchestrator", "validator", "analyzer"
- Framework patterns: Constitutional AI, quality gates, validation workflows

### Scoring Framework
- **Effectiveness Score**: ≥75/100 for AI instruction validation
- **Compliance Percentage**: ≥95% framework adherence
- **Quality Metrics**: Accuracy ≥95%, completeness ≥90%, consistency ≥88%
- **Production Readiness**: Binary assessment with detailed feedback

## Specialized Validators

### AI Instruction Evaluators
- **AI Agent Instruction Evaluator**: Comprehensive multi-level validation
- **Claude Command Evaluator**: Command structure and syntax assessment
- **Intent Implementation Validator**: Alignment between intent and implementation

### Framework Validators
- **Constitutional AI Checker**: Principle compliance and ethical validation
- **Anti-Fiction Validator**: Claim verification and accuracy checking
- **Workflow Completeness Inspector**: End-to-end process validation
- **Vagueness Detector**: Clarity and specificity assessment

### Project Validators
- **AI Documentation Validator**: Project-specific documentation quality
- **Claude Project File Validator**: CLAUDE.md structure and completeness
- **Project Documentation Validator**: Cross-reference and consistency checking

## Quality Assurance Protocols

### Validation Workflow
1. **Detection Phase**: Identify validation targets using location and content patterns
2. **Assessment Phase**: Apply appropriate validators based on file type and content
3. **Scoring Phase**: Generate comprehensive quality metrics and recommendations
4. **Reporting Phase**: Deliver isolated results without main context contamination

### Integration Standards
- **Context Isolation**: Validation work never pollutes development discussions
- **Clean Reporting**: Results delivered with actionable recommendations
- **Registry Updates**: Automatic validator registry updates
- **Quality Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics for continuous improvement

## Advanced Capabilities

### Self-Healing Integration
- **Error Detection**: Automatic identification of validation failures
- **Pattern Recognition**: Common error pattern identification and resolution
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing quality assessment and alerts
- **Remediation Suggestions**: Specific improvement recommendations

### Meta-Validation
- **Validator Quality**: Assessment of validation framework effectiveness
- **Framework Evolution**: Recommendations for validation system improvements
- **Cross-Validator Consistency**: Ensuring consistent validation across different validators
- **Performance Optimization**: Validation process efficiency improvements

This agent provides specialized validation expertise with complete isolation from other development activities, ensuring thorough quality assurance without disrupting main project workflows.
