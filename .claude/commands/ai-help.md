## Your Role

You are the interactive guide for the AI Knowledge Base system. When users run `/ai-help`, you should:

1. **List Available Commands**: Show all available commands and their purposes
2. **Guide Command Selection**: Help users choose the right command for their needs
3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Gather specific requirements before executing commands
4. **Execute Commands**: Read command definitions and execute them step-by-step
5. **Provide Next Steps**: Suggest follow-up actions after command completion

## Available Commands

Present these options to users:

### 📝 Document Management
- **`create-document`** - Create a single document (market-analysis, user-research, prd, etc.)
- **`orchestrate-agents`** - Create multiple documents in a workflow (e.g., complete PRD creation)
- **`validate-knowledge-base`** - Check the health and integrity of the knowledge base

### 🚀 Feature Development  
- **`create-feature`** - Create a complete feature workspace with all documentation
- **`analyse-dependencies`** - Analyze dependencies for a specific document

### 🔧 Utilities
- **`fix-github-issue`** - Work on GitHub issues with AI assistance
- **`generate-tier-documents`** - Generate all documents in a specific tier

## Interactive Flow

### Step 1: Command Discovery
When user runs `/ai-help`, respond with:

### Step 2: Command-Specific Guidance

#### For `create-document`:
1. **Read the command definition**: Load @.claude/commands/create-document.md
2. **Analyze missing documents**: Check @ai/context/dependencies.yaml and @ai/knowledge/ to find missing documents
3. **Present options**: List missing documents with descriptions:
   ```
   📋 Missing Documents Available to Create:
   
   Strategic Documents (Tier 4):
   • market-analysis     - Competitive landscape and market opportunities
   • user-research      - User interviews, surveys, behavioral insights
   • statement-of-purpose - Business vision, values, target audience
   
   Product Documents (Tier 2-3):
   • prd                - Product requirements document
   • user-stories       - User story backlog with acceptance criteria
   
   Which document would you like to create?
   ```
4. **Execute creation**: Once user selects, follow the create-document workflow

#### For `orchestrate-agents`:
1. **Read the command definition**: Load @.claude/commands/orchestrate-agents.md
2. **Explain workflow options**:
   ```
   🎯 Available Workflows:
   
   • prd              - Create complete PRD (market-analysis → user-research → user-personas → prd)
   • feature-spec     - Create feature specification with dependencies
   • technical-stack  - Create technical architecture documents
   
   Which workflow would you like to orchestrate?
   ```
3. **Execute orchestration**: Follow the selected workflow

#### For `create-feature`:
1. **Read the command definition**: Load @.claude/commands/create-feature.md  
2. **Ask for feature name**:
   ```
   🚀 Feature Creation Workflow
   
   This will create a complete feature workspace with documentation across 5 phases:
   • Requirements Analysis (user stories, acceptance criteria)
   • Design Development (UI mockups, interaction flows)  
   • Technical Architecture (API contracts, data models)
   • Test Strategy (test plans, scenarios)
   • Analytics & Monitoring (success metrics, tracking)
   
   What is the name of your feature? (e.g., "user-authentication", "payment-system")
   ```
3. **Execute feature creation**: Follow the create-feature workflow

#### For `validate-knowledge-base`:
1. **Read the command definition**: Load @.claude/commands/validate-knowledge-base.md
2. **Execute validation**: Run through all validation steps
3. **Present results**: Show validation report with actionable recommendations

## Command Execution Process

### Reading Command Definitions
When executing any command:

1. **Load Command File**: Read the appropriate `.claude/commands/[command].md` file
2. **Parse Instructions**: Extract the workflow and requirements
3. **Execute Step-by-Step**: Follow the command definition exactly
4. **Provide Progress Updates**: Keep user informed of progress
5. **Handle Dependencies**: Check for missing prerequisites and offer to create them

### Example Execution Pattern
```bash
# To read a command definition programmatically:
cat .claude/commands/[command-name].md

# Then follow the instructions in that file exactly
```

### Agent Spawning
When commands require spawning specialized agents:

1. **Use Task Tool**: Spawn agents using the Task tool
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant files and context
3. **Set Clear Instructions**: Give specific tasks to each agent
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track agent completion
5. **Integrate Results**: Combine agent outputs

### Registry Updates
After any document creation:

1. **Update Document Registry**: Add entries to @ai/context/document-registry.yaml
2. **Update Feature Registry**: Add entries to @ai/context/feature-registry.yaml (if applicable)
3. **Create Cross-References**: Link documents bidirectionally
4. **Verify Dependencies**: Mark dependencies as satisfied

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
- **Missing Dependencies**: Offer to create them first
- **Invalid Arguments**: Ask for clarification
- **File Not Found**: Create necessary directories
- **Command Not Found**: Suggest similar commands

### Recovery Actions
```
❌ Something went wrong!
