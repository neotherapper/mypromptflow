# /validate-pr Command

**AI Agent Instruction**: Revolutionary PR validation with intent-implementation alignment and gh CLI integration using progressive loading and multi-tier fallbacks.

## Usage
```bash
/validate-pr [pr-number]
```

## Command Description

**Target AI Agent**: Claude Code with Task, Bash, Read, LS, and Glob tool access  
**Execution Type**: Multi-phase workflow with gh CLI integration and embedded fallbacks  
**Resource Efficiency**: Conditional specialist activation based on file type detection  
**Dependencies**: Self-sufficient with multi-tier fallback strategies for all external dependencies  
**Revolutionary Feature**: Intent vs Implementation semantic alignment validation

This instruction guides AI agents through revolutionary PR validation using GitHub CLI with systematic fallbacks, progressive loading optimization, and the breakthrough intent-implementation-validator for semantic alignment checking.

## Progressive Loading Implementation

When this command is executed, perform the following progressive loading workflow:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Asset Discovery with GitHub Integration

**AI Agent Instructions**: Execute these specific Claude tool operations in sequence:

**Step 1.1: Validator Registry Discovery**  
Use Read tool to check: `meta/validation/validators/registry.yaml`
- **If file exists**: Parse YAML content to extract validator locations and capabilities including the revolutionary intent-implementation-validator
- **If file missing**: Use embedded validator definitions (see Embedded Validators section)
- **Output**: Display validator count, available capabilities, and revolutionary intent validation status

**Step 1.2: Enhanced PR Data Extraction with Multi-Tier Fallbacks**  

**Primary Method - GitHub CLI Integration (‚â§30s timeout):**
```bash
# Tier 1: GitHub CLI for comprehensive PR data
gh pr view [pr-number] --json title,body,labels,author,baseRefName,url,state
gh pr diff [pr-number] --name-only
```
- **Success case**: Extract PR metadata (title, description, labels) and file changes list
- **Timeout/Error detection**: If gh CLI fails or times out (‚â§30s), proceed to Tier 2

**Secondary Method - Git Commands with gh Fallback (‚â§45s timeout):**
```bash  
# Tier 2: Git commands combined with basic gh metadata
gh pr view [pr-number] --json title,body,labels  # metadata only
git diff --name-only origin/master HEAD  # file changes
```
- **Success case**: Parse PR metadata and file list for type classification
- **Error detection**: If file count is 0, check git branch status and report configuration issue
- **Timeout/Error**: If git commands fail, proceed to Tier 3

**Fallback Method - File System Analysis (‚â§60s timeout):**
```bash
# Tier 3: File system discovery with pattern matching
# Use LS tool to scan current directory recursively
# Use Glob tool with pattern **/*.{md,ts,tsx,py,yaml,yml,js,jsx}
# Filter by recent modification timestamp patterns
```

**Step 1.3: Revolutionary Intent-Implementation Analysis Setup**
**BREAKTHROUGH VALIDATION**: Initialize intent-implementation-validator for semantic alignment checking:
- **Validator Location**: `meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/intent-implementation-validator.md`
- **Purpose**: Validate PR actually does what it claims to do (industry-first capability)
- **Threshold**: ‚â•85% semantic alignment required for approval
- **Revolutionary Scenarios**: Scope creep detection, incomplete implementation identification, mislabeled changes flagging

**Step 1.4: Discovery Summary**  
Output structured summary:
```
üîç Revolutionary PR Validation Discovery Results:
üìã Available validators: [number] ([validator-names])
üöÄ Revolutionary intent validation: ACTIVE (‚â•85% alignment threshold)
üìÅ Changed files detected: [number] files
üéØ File types detected: [types-list]
üìä Data extraction method: [Tier 1: gh CLI | Tier 2: git+gh | Tier 3: filesystem]
```

**Context Storage**: Store validator registry data, PR metadata, and file list in working memory for Phase 2

### Phase 2: Intelligent File Type Detection and Intent Analysis

**AI Agent Instructions**: Process file list and PR metadata from Phase 1 using enhanced pattern matching:

**Step 2.1: Initialize Enhanced File Type Categories**  
Create working variables for comprehensive file classification:
- `claude_command_files`: Files matching `.claude/commands/*.md` pattern
- `claude_md_files`: Files named `CLAUDE.md` 
- `ai_agent_files`: Files in `ai/agents/` or `ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/` directories
- `project_documentation_files`: Files matching `*/progress.md`, `*/task-list.md`, `*/project-purpose.md`, `*/research-integration.md`
- `ai_consumable_docs`: Files matching `projects/*/docs/**/*.md` pattern
- `typescript_files`: Files with `.ts` or `.tsx` extensions
- `python_files`: Files with `.py` extension
- `yaml_files`: Files with `.yaml` or `.yml` extensions
- `generic_md_files`: Other `.md` files

**Step 2.2: Enhanced Pattern Matching Classification**  
For each file from Phase 1 file list, apply enhanced pattern matching:
- Check file path contains `.claude/commands/` and ends with `.md` ‚Üí claude_command_files
- Check filename equals `CLAUDE.md` ‚Üí claude_md_files
- Check path contains `ai/agents/` or `ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/` ‚Üí ai_agent_files
- Check filename matches `progress.md`, `task-list.md`, `project-purpose.md`, `research-integration.md` ‚Üí project_documentation_files
- Check path matches `projects/*/docs/**/*.md` pattern ‚Üí ai_consumable_docs
- Check extension `.ts` or `.tsx` ‚Üí typescript_files
- Check extension `.py` ‚Üí python_files
- Check extension `.yaml` or `.yml` ‚Üí yaml_files
- Check extension `.md` (remaining) ‚Üí generic_md_files

**Step 2.3: Enhanced Priority Classification and Reporting**  
Output comprehensive classification results with priority levels:
```
üéØ Enhanced File Type Detection Results:
  ü§ñ Claude Commands: [count] files [CRITICAL]
  üß† CLAUDE.md Files: [count] files [CRITICAL - SPECIALIZED VALIDATOR]  
  üëë AI Agent Instructions: [count] files [HIGH]
  üìã Project Documentation: [count] files [HIGH - NEW CATEGORY]
  üóÇÔ∏è AI-Consumable Docs: [count] files [HIGH - NEW CATEGORY]

### Phase 4: Revolutionary Result Aggregation with Intent Analysis

**AI Agent Instructions**: Collect and synthesize results from spawned specialists including MANDATORY intent validation:

**Step 4.1: Wait for Specialist Completion with Intent Priority**  
Monitor Task tool executions until all spawned specialists complete:
- **Priority 1**: Intent-Implementation Validator (MANDATORY - must complete)
- **Priority 2**: Traditional file-type validators (conditional based on detected files)
- Apply timeout handling (maximum 300 seconds per specialist)
- If timeout occurs: Collect partial results and note incomplete specialists
- **Critical**: Intent validation must complete for PR approval determination

**Step 4.2: Revolutionary Intent-Implementation Result Collection**
**BREAKTHROUGH VALIDATION RESULTS**:
Extract critical metrics from intent-implementation-validator:
```yaml
intent_validation_results:
  overall_alignment_score: "[0-100]"
  confidence_level: "[high|medium|low|unreliable]"
  semantic_alignment: "[0-100]"
  scope_consistency: "[0-100]"  
  completeness: "[0-100]"
  critical_issues:
    scope_creep: "[none|minor|moderate|major]"
    missing_implementations: "[count and descriptions]"
    undisclosed_changes: "[count and descriptions]"
  approval_recommendation: "[APPROVE ‚â•85% | REVIEW <85% | BLOCK critical issues]"
```

**Step 4.3: Traditional Specialist Result Collection**  
For each completed file-type specialist, collect structured results:

**Result Collection Pattern**:
1. **Check Output Files**: Look for specialist result files in expected locations under `meta/validation/reports/pr-[number]/`
2. **Parse Structured Data**: Extract key metrics from specialist outputs:
   - Files processed count
   - Issues found with severity levels
   - Validation coverage percentage  
   - Specific recommendations generated
3. **Aggregate Metrics**: Combine individual specialist results

**Step 4.4: Calculate Enhanced Validation Metrics**  
Compute comprehensive validation effectiveness:
- `intent_alignment_score`: Score from intent-implementation-validator (0-100)
- `total_files_processed`: Sum from all file-type specialists
- `total_issues_found`: Sum of all detected issues across all validators
- `validation_coverage`: (total_files_processed / total_files_in_pr) √ó 100
- `resource_efficiency`: Based on conditional specialist activation plus mandatory intent validation

**Step 4.5: Generate Revolutionary Comprehensive Report**  
Output final validation results:
