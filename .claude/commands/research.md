Conduct comprehensive research using the intelligent hybrid orchestrator for: $ARGUMENTS

## Research Workflow:

1. **Extract Research Context** from the request
2. **Analyze Complexity** using context analyzer
3. **Select Optimal Methods** based on complexity and domain  
4. **Execute Research** using multi-agent approach
5. **Generate Findings** with comprehensive analysis
6. **Save Research** following required file structure

## Execution Process:

**Research Orchestrator Navigation:**
- Read orchestrator integration: `@research/orchestrator/integration/claude-orchestrator-integration.yaml`
- Use context analyzer: `@research/orchestrator/engines/context-analyzer.yaml`
- Select methods from: `@research/orchestrator/config/method-registry.yaml`
- Follow selection rules: `@research/orchestrator/config/selection-rules.yaml`
- Execute using multi-agent mode with Task tool capability
- Save research to: `research/findings/[topic]/` with proper file structure
- Follow mandatory research completion requirements
