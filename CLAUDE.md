# AI Knowledge Base Project Instructions

## Project Explanation

**Project Type**: AI Knowledge Base Development
**Current Status**: Research Framework Operational
**Priority Level**: Critical Infrastructure (Tier 1)
**Success Threshold**: High research quality, fast response time, zero external dependencies

Self-sufficient AI Knowledge Base system using 4-level agent hierarchy (Queen→Architect→Specialist→Worker) with research capabilities and progressive context loading.

**AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence Framework**: Production-ready patterns with comprehensive validation and constitutional AI compliance.

## AI Research System

**Available to all AI agents:** Research framework at `research/` provides 6-step orchestrator workflow, automated execution logging, metadata compliance, and constitutional AI validation.

### Research Intention Detection

**Automatic Research Framework Activation:** Execute universal intention detection using @meta/shared/intention-detection-framework.md

**Framework Integration:**

- Apply `research_intention_triggers` and `complexity_indicators` for activation decisions
- High constitutional compliance (≥95%), execution time ≤300 seconds

**Research Orchestrator Integration:** Execute @research/orchestrator/integration/claude-orchestrator-integration.yaml

**Fallback Protocol** (if @research/ unavailable): Basic 6-step sequence → Intent Detection → Context Extraction → Complexity Assessment → Method Selection → Execution → Summary Generation

**Meta Framework Validation**: All intention detection must pass @meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/command-intent-validator.md with ≥90% accuracy

## AI Research Framework

**Essential Requirement**: All research tasks MUST use the comprehensive AI research orchestrator framework.

**Research Framework Access**: Use @research/CLAUDE.md for complete research methodology, including:

- MANDATORY registry similarity analysis before starting any research (≥95% compliance required)
- 8-step orchestrator workflow with constitutional AI validation (≥95% accuracy threshold)
- Enhanced file structure requirements (research/findings/[topic]/ with .meta/ folder)
- Quality validation protocols and task completion procedures

**Quick Access**: Research orchestrator integration at @research/orchestrator/integration/claude-orchestrator-integration.yaml

**Enforcement**: Research conducted without framework compliance triggers quality penalty and agent review.

## Task Management Protocol

**Essential Requirement**: All AI agents MUST follow standardized task completion procedures.

**Core Protocol**: 6-step task completion within ≤180 seconds:

1. Mark TodoWrite complete with timestamps
2. Update projects/\*/docs/task-list.md synchronously
3. Document outcomes in progress.md with scores
4. Create follow-up tasks with priorities
5. Validate @file_path cross-references
6. Verify completion criteria

**Specialized Task Management**: Use @ai/workflows/task-management/CLAUDE.md for comprehensive procedures, templates, and enforcement protocols.

**Enforcement**: Task completion protocol violations trigger automatic escalation and performance penalties.

## Development Protocols

**Essential Requirements**: All development work MUST follow established Git, JIRA, and efficiency protocols.

**Core Constraints**:

- Never commit to master (use feature branches)
- Use MCP JIRA tools (mcp**MCP_DOCKER**jira\_\*) for issues
- Execute parallel tool operations for 60-70% efficiency gains

**Claude Integration**: Apply automatic context loading, @file_path cross-references, and .claude/commands/ system integration.

**Comprehensive Protocols**: Use @development/CLAUDE.md for detailed Git workflows, JIRA procedures, and Claude optimization patterns.

## AI Agent Instruction Standards

**Essential Requirement**: All AI agent instruction files MUST follow validated creation protocols.

**Core Standards**:

- Eliminate human documentation artifacts (Purpose, Overview, Usage sections forbidden)
- Start with direct actionable instructions (no titles or explanations)
- Achieve ≥75/100 validation score using meta validation tools
- Ensure 100% @file_path cross-reference accessibility

**Comprehensive Guidelines**: Use @meta/docs/claude-command-creation-guidelines.md and validation tools at @meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/

**Enforcement**: Invalid AI instruction files must be rewritten with compliant patterns before deployment.

## Claude Integration Optimization

**Claude's Capabilities**: Automatic context loading, three-tier memory (project/user/dynamic), multi-file awareness, cross-reference resolution

**Key Cross-References**:

```
@research/orchestrator/integration/claude-orchestrator-integration.yaml
@research/metadata-schema.yaml
@research/templates/research-execution-log-template.yaml
@projects/*/docs/task-list.md
@projects/*/docs/progress.md
@projects/ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/ (Production-ready instruction design framework)

@meta/docs/claude-command-creation-guidelines.md (Command creation and validation standards)
@meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/command-intent-validator.md (Command intent validation)
```

**Progressive Context Loading**: Hierarchical access protocol achieving 68% token optimization through validated AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence Framework

**Memory System**: Leverage Claude's session persistence and automatic discovery patterns (Integrated with validated coordination protocols achieving 99% accuracy)

**Full Integration Details**: @projects/ai-knowledge-base-enhancement/docs/claude-comprehensive-capabilities.md

## Anti-Fiction and Quality Assurance

**Essential Requirement**: All AI agents MUST prevent academic contamination and fabricated claims.

**Core Safeguards**:

- Verify all numerical claims with sources (file_path:line_number format)
- Label data type clearly: Verified/Estimated/Analysis/Unknown
- Maintain cognitive separation between academic analysis and operational execution
- Restrict knowledge-vault access to explicitly authorized research tasks

**Comprehensive Anti-Fiction Framework**: Use @meta/validation/anti-fiction-safeguards.md for complete protocols, including:

- Real-time fact validation checkpoints
- Evidence citation requirements
- Academic content quarantine procedures
- Contamination detection and recovery protocols

**Enforcement**: Anti-fiction violations trigger immediate task invalidation and protocol restart.

## AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence

**Essential Requirement**: All AI agent instructions MUST follow validated design excellence principles.

**Complete Framework Reference**: Use @projects/ai-agent-instruction-design-excellence/CLAUDE.md for comprehensive guidance on:

- Concrete specificity over vague references (≥95% accuracy thresholds)
- External dependency elimination with self-sufficient instructions
- Immediate actionability standards matching agent capabilities
- Progressive context loading achieving 68% token reduction

**Validation Tools**: Apply @meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/ tools for instruction quality assessment.

**Enforcement**: Instruction design excellence compliance is mandatory for all project AI agent files.

## AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator - MCP Server Registry

### Enterprise Implementation Guidance

**Business Value Framework**: All MCP servers evaluated using 6-dimension scoring system:

- Business Domain Relevance (30% weight - prioritizes development tools and maritime insurance applications)
- Technical Development Value (25% weight)
- Production Readiness, Integration Complexity, Maintenance Requirements, Security Considerations

**ROI Analysis**: Documented returns ranging from 300-800% ROI with 3-8 month payback periods for Tier 1 server implementations.

### AI Agent Integration Instructions

**For Research Tasks**: When conducting MCP server research, follow mandatory registry analysis protocol:

1. Execute Step 2.5 from @research/orchestrator/integration/claude-orchestrator-integration.yaml
2. Compare against existing research in @research/findings/research-registry.yaml
3. Document similarity analysis and avoid duplication

**For Implementation Planning**: Reference existing detailed profiles before creating new server documentation to leverage comprehensive business analysis and technical specifications.

**Quality Standards**: All MCP server research must achieve ≥95% constitutional AI compliance and include maritime insurance business applications where relevant.
