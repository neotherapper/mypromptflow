# AI Knowledge Base Project Instructions

## Project Explanation

**Project Type**: AI Knowledge Base Development
**Current Status**: Research Framework Operational
**Priority Level**: Critical Infrastructure (Tier 1)
**Success Threshold**: High research quality, fast response time, zero external dependencies

This project creates a self-sufficient AI Knowledge Base system using 4-level agent hierarchy (Queen→Architect→Specialist→Worker) with research capabilities and progressive context loading.

**Enhanced with AI Agent Instruction Design Excellence Framework**: Production-ready instruction design patterns providing comprehensive validation, assessment automation, and constitutional AI compliance. Framework eliminates vague references and external dependencies through validated design principles.

## AI Research System

**Available to all AI agents:** This project includes a research framework at `research/` that any AI agent can use autonomously. Framework provides: 6-step orchestrator workflow, automated execution logging, metadata compliance, and constitutional AI validation.

### Research Intention Detection

**Automatic Research Framework Activation:** Execute universal intention detection using @meta/shared/intention-detection-framework.md

**Framework Integration:**
- **Intention Detection**: Apply `research_intention_triggers` from meta framework
- **Context Analysis**: Use `complexity_indicators` for complexity assessment (simple/moderate/complex)
- **Routing Logic**: Apply `research_routing_conditions` for framework activation decisions
- **Quality Threshold**: High constitutional compliance (≥95%), reasonable execution time

**Research Orchestrator Integration:** Execute @research/orchestrator/integration/claude-orchestrator-integration.yaml

**Fallback Protocol** (if @research/ unavailable): Basic 6-step sequence → Intent Detection → Context Extraction → Complexity Assessment → Method Selection → Execution → Summary Generation

**Meta Framework Validation**: All intention detection must pass @meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/command-intent-validator.md with ≥90% accuracy

## MANDATORY Research Framework Compliance

5. ✅ Cross-references validated (Accuracy: 100%, Broken links: 0)
6. ✅ Quality verification complete (Constitutional compliance: XX%, Success criteria: met)

Protocol execution time: XXX seconds (Target: ≤240s)"

**ENFORCEMENT**: AI agents that do NOT execute this protocol within 240 seconds trigger automatic escalation and task re-assignment.**

### Cross-Project Task Synchronization

**AI agents MUST check these specific locations for task updates (Target: ≤60 seconds scan time):**

**Primary Sources** (≤30s):
- `projects/ai-knowledge-base-enhancement/docs/task-list.md` - Master project task list
- Local TodoWrite tool state - Real-time task tracking with timestamps
- `projects/*/docs/progress.md` files - Historical completion records

**Secondary Sources** (≤30s):
- `research/findings/research-registry.yaml` - Research task completion tracking
- `projects/*/docs/research-integration.md` - Cross-project task dependencies

**Synchronization Protocol**: TodoWrite tool = master task tracker. Project task-list.md files MUST mirror TodoWrite status within 15 seconds of updates. Validation: 100% consistency required.

### Task Discovery and Creation Protocol

**When research reveals new tasks, AI agents MUST execute this 4-step protocol (≤120 seconds):**

1. **TodoWrite Addition** (≤30s): Add tasks with specific attributes:

   - Cross-project implications
   - Timeline coordination requirements

4. **Effort Estimation & Classification** (≤15s): Apply effort calculation formula: (complexity_score × 1.5) + (dependency_count × 0.5) = estimated_hours

### Quality Assurance for Task Updates

**Before completing any session, AI agents MUST verify this 5-point checklist (≤90 seconds verification):**

**Task Tracking Verification** (≤25s):
- [ ] All completed tasks marked as "completed" in TodoWrite tool with timestamps
- [ ] All relevant `projects/*/docs/task-list.md` files updated with completion status
- [ ] 100% synchronization between TodoWrite and project task lists verified

**Documentation Verification** (≤30s):
- [ ] `progress.md` reflects current status with quality scores and completion metrics

- [ ] Success criteria met for all marked-complete tasks
- [ ] Quality scores recorded (accuracy, completeness, consistency) for research outputs
- [ ] Next session priorities clearly defined with effort estimates

**ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL:** Any AI agent that fails to execute this task completion protocol triggers automatic escalation:

**Immediate Actions**:
- Task marked as "incomplete" and flagged for review
- Agent performance score penalty (-0.5 points)
- Automatic notification to session supervisor

**Escalation Thresholds**:
- 1st failure: Warning + protocol re-execution requirement
- 2nd failure: Session supervision requirement
- 3rd failure: Agent retraining and capability assessment

**Recovery Process**: Failed agents must restart task completion protocol within 300 seconds and achieve 100% compliance before proceeding to new tasks.

## Development Workflow

**Git Workflow Protocol** (MANDATORY):
- **NEVER** commit directly to the `master` branch (automated prevention: merge conflicts will result)
- **ALWAYS** create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[descriptive-name]` (naming convention: feature/task-description-YYYY-MM-DD)
- **REQUIRED**: All commits must pass pre-commit validation (quality score ≥85%, no external dependencies)

**JIRA Integration Protocol** (MANDATORY):
- **JIRA Access**: Use MCP JIRA server tools (mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_*) for all JIRA operations
- **Search Issues**: Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_search` with JQL queries (e.g., `key = SCRUM-33`)
- **Add Comments**: Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_add_comment` with issue_key and comment parameters
- **Get Issue Details**: Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_get_issue` for comprehensive issue information
- **Update Issues**: Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__jira_update_issue` for status changes and field updates
- **Comment Format**: Use markdown formatting for structured, professional comments
- **Documentation**: Always reference supporting documentation paths in comments

**Efficiency Protocol**:
- **Parallel Tool Execution**: When performing multiple independent operations, invoke ALL relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially
  - **Example**: Use multiple Bash tools in single response: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log --oneline -5` 
  - **Research Example**: Run `WebFetch`, `Read @research/templates/`, and `Glob **/*research*.md` concurrently
  - **Validation Example**: Execute `Read file1.md`, `Read file2.md`, `Grep "pattern" **/*.md` simultaneously
- **Target Efficiency**: 60-70% time reduction through parallel processing
- **Quality Maintenance**: Parallel execution must maintain ≥95% accuracy and ≥90% consistency scores

**Claude Integration Optimization**:
- **Automatic Context Loading**: Execute recursive file discovery protocol (scan depth: 5 levels, file types: .md/.yaml/.json, timeout: 30s)
- **Cross-Reference Utilization**: Implement @file_path patterns (validation: 100% accuracy, resolution time: ≤2s per reference)
- **Command System Integration**: Access @.claude/commands/ using standardized execution protocol (command validation: ≤5s, error rate: ≤2%)
  - **Available Commands**: @.claude/commands/ai-help.md, @.claude/commands/improve-claude.md, @.claude/commands/validate-pr.md, @.claude/commands/research.md, @.claude/commands/create-document.md, @.claude/commands/create-feature.md
  - **Execution Pattern**: Use Read tool to load command definitions → Execute step-by-step instructions → Apply $ARGUMENTS pattern for parameters
  - **Command Guidelines**: Follow @meta/docs/claude-command-creation-guidelines.md for command structure and validation
  - **Intention Detection**: Use @meta/shared/intention-detection-framework.md for command routing and natural language processing
- **Memory Persistence**: Structure work using three-tier memory hierarchy (project context: persistent, user context: session-based, dynamic context: task-specific loading)

## AI Agent Instruction File Creation Protocol

**CRITICAL: When creating ANY AI agent instruction file (.md files for AI consumption), Claude MUST apply these validated best practices:**

### Mandatory Pre-Creation Validation Requirements

**Before Writing Any AI Instruction File:**
- **Apply Guidelines**: Follow @meta/docs/claude-command-creation-guidelines.md patterns
- **Eliminate Human Artifacts**: No Purpose, Overview, Description, Implementation Notes, Usage sections
- **Direct Instruction Start**: Begin with actionable instruction, never titles or explanations  
- **AI Consumption Optimization**: Every line must serve AI agent execution, not human explanation

### Required File Creation Protocol

**Step 1: Structure Validation (≤30s)**
- Start with direct actionable instruction (no "# Title" or "## Purpose" sections)
- Use structured data blocks (YAML) for configuration and patterns
- Include specific @file_path references for cross-references
- Define measurable criteria with specific thresholds

**Step 2: Content Validation (≤60s)**
- Replace explanatory text with executable instructions
- Convert "This framework provides..." to "Apply the following patterns..."
- Use concrete specificity: exact commands, specific procedures, measurable criteria
- Eliminate vague terms: "appropriately", "effectively", "good quality"

**Step 3: Validation Tool Application (≤90s)**
- Execute @meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/ai-agent-instruction-evaluator.md
- Apply @meta/validation/validators/ai-instruction/command-intent-validator.md  
- Achieve ≥75/100 validation score before completion
- Address all critical validation issues identified

### Prohibited Patterns (Immediate Failure)

**These sections/patterns are FORBIDDEN in AI instruction files:**
- ❌ **Purpose sections** ("**Purpose**: This framework..." - human documentation artifact)
- ❌ **Overview sections** ("## Framework Overview" - meta-explanatory content)
- ❌ **Description sections** ("## Description", "This command does..." - explains instead of instructs)
- ❌ **Usage examples** ("## Usage", "Users can..." - human-oriented explanations)
- ❌ **Implementation Notes** ("## Implementation Notes" - meta-commentary)
- ❌ **Meta-commentary** ("This framework provides", "This instruction enables")

### Required Patterns for AI Instructions

**✅ Correct AI Instruction Patterns:**
- **Direct Actionable Start**: "Execute the following pattern matching rules:", "Apply these keyword detection triggers:"
- **Structured Data**: Use YAML blocks for configuration, patterns, and routing logic
- **Specific References**: @file_path patterns for cross-references and integration points
- **Measurable Criteria**: Specific thresholds (≥95% accuracy, ≤2s response time) and success metrics
- **Concrete Execution Steps**: Numbered steps with exact commands and validation checkpoints

### Enforcement Protocol

**Validation Failure Actions:**
- **Score < 75/100**: Rewrite file from scratch applying correct patterns
- **Human Artifacts Detected**: Remove all Purpose/Overview/Description sections immediately
- **Vague Language Found**: Replace with specific, measurable, actionable instructions
- **Cross-Reference Errors**: Verify all @file_path references are accessible

**Success Criteria:**

## 🚨 MANDATORY Anti-Fiction and Cognitive Contamination Prevention

**CRITICAL**: AI agents must prevent academic contamination and fabricated claims through enhanced safeguards.

### Discovery: Academic Contamination Risk

**Problem Identified**: Academic knowledge mixed with AI agent instructions causes cognitive contamination leading to:
- **Fiction Generation**: Making up statistics instead of using actual data  
- **Academic Creep**: Adding research-style validation where none exists
- **Performance Metric Fabrication**: Creating credible-sounding but false statistics
- **Instruction Pollution**: Mixing research findings with actionable commands

**Root Cause**: AI agents become contaminated when processing academic content alongside operational instructions.

### Enhanced Anti-Fiction Safeguards

#### Safeguard 1: Real-Time Fact Validation
**BEFORE ANY NUMERICAL CLAIM**:
- [ ] Source identified and verifiable (file path + line number)
- [ ] Actual measurement vs. estimation clearly labeled  
- [ ] Evidence trail documented with timestamps
- [ ] Anti-fiction protocol checkpoint passed

#### Safeguard 2: Mandatory Evidence Citation
**EVERY CLAIM MUST INCLUDE**:
- **Verified Data**: `Source: file_path:line_number` OR
- **Estimation**: `Estimated based on [specific methodology]` OR  
- **Analysis**: `Opinion based on [criteria] - not measured` OR
- **Unknown**: `No source available - cannot verify`

#### Safeguard 3: Academic Content Quarantine
**WHEN ANALYZING ACADEMIC CONTENT**:
- [ ] Process in analysis mode separate from execution mode
- [ ] Document academic claims as "Source Claims" not "Verified Data"
- [ ] Use distinct formatting for academic vs. factual content
- [ ] Apply cognitive firewall between analysis and operational reporting

#### Safeguard 4: Contamination Detection
**DETECT ACADEMIC CONTAMINATION PATTERNS**:
- Using research-style language in operational reports
- Adding percentage claims without source verification
- Generating "effectiveness" or "success rate" statistics
- Including academic justification in actionable instructions

#### Safeguard 5: Knowledge-Vault Access Control
**STRICT ACCESS RESTRICTIONS**:
- **Normal Operations**: AI agents MUST NOT access `knowledge-vault/` files
- **Research Tasks**: Only when explicitly instructed by humans
- **Academic Content**: Process separately from operational instructions
- **Cross-References**: Only reference actionable instruction files

### Cognitive Contamination Prevention Protocols

#### Protocol 1: Content Type Identification
```markdown
**BEFORE PROCESSING ANY FILE**:
1. Identify content type: Academic/Research vs. Actionable Instructions
2. Apply appropriate processing mode: Analysis vs. Execution  
3. Maintain cognitive separation between modes
4. Prevent academic style from influencing operational reporting
```

#### Protocol 2: Evidence-Based Reporting
```markdown
**FOR ALL CLAIMS AND STATISTICS**:
1. Verify source: Actual data vs. estimation vs. opinion
2. Label uncertainty: High/Medium/Low confidence with reasoning
3. Provide evidence trail: File paths, line numbers, timestamps
4. Avoid fabrication: "Unknown" is acceptable, fiction is not
```

#### Protocol 3: Academic Style Prevention
```markdown
**OPERATIONAL REPORTING STANDARDS**:
1. Use direct, actionable language only
2. Avoid academic phrases: "research shows", "studies indicate" 
3. Focus on configuration parameters and thresholds
4. Eliminate research justification from instructions
```

### Knowledge-Vault Restrictions

**AI agents are RESTRICTED from accessing `knowledge-vault/` during normal operations.**

**Knowledge-Vault Contains**:
- Research findings and academic validation
- Performance metrics and effectiveness statistics
- Success stories and implementation reports  
- Academic justification and research validation

**Access Policy**:
- **Forbidden**: Normal operational tasks
- **Permitted**: When explicitly instructed by humans for research/reporting
- **Purpose**: Prevent cognitive contamination during instruction execution

### Enforcement and Validation

#### Anti-Fiction Validation Checklist
**Before completing any task involving claims or statistics**:
- [ ] All numerical claims verified with sources
- [ ] No fabricated performance metrics included
- [ ] Academic content processed separately from instructions
- [ ] Knowledge-vault access restrictions followed
- [ ] Evidence trail documented for all claims

#### Contamination Recovery Protocol
**If academic contamination detected**:
1. **Stop Processing**: Halt current task immediately
2. **Identify Source**: Locate contaminating academic content
3. **Quarantine Content**: Separate academic from operational content
4. **Restart Task**: Begin again with clean, actionable instructions only
5. **Document Incident**: Record contamination source for prevention

**ENFORCEMENT**: Violations of anti-fiction safeguards trigger immediate task invalidation and protocol restart.
