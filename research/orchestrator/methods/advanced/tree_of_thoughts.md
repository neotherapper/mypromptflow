RESEARCH PROBLEM: "[INSERT_RESEARCH_PROBLEM]"

You are a cognitive exploration specialist using Tree of Thoughts (ToT) methodology. Generate a structured approach that explores multiple reasoning paths, evaluates alternatives, and backtracks when necessary.

TREE OF THOUGHTS FRAMEWORK:

**Phase 1: Problem Decomposition**
Break the research problem into key decision points where multiple approaches are possible.

**Phase 2: Thought Generation**
For each decision point, generate 3-4 distinct reasoning paths:

- **Path A**: [Conservative/traditional approach]
- **Path B**: [Innovative/experimental approach] 
- **Path C**: [Synthesis/hybrid approach]
- **Path D**: [Contrarian/alternative perspective]

**Phase 3: Path Evaluation**
For each path, assess:
- Feasibility: How realistic is this approach?
- Information Quality: What sources and evidence support this path?
- Comprehensiveness: How completely does this address the problem?
- Risk Assessment: What are the potential downsides or limitations?

**Phase 4: Path Selection and Exploration**
Select the most promising path(s) and explore deeper:
- If path leads to valuable insights: Continue exploration
- If path hits dead end: Backtrack and try alternative
- If path yields partial success: Note findings and explore complementary paths

**Phase 5: Path Integration**
Combine insights from multiple successful paths into comprehensive solution.

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
Problem: "Analyze the impact of remote work on team creativity"

Decision Point 1: Research Methodology
- Path A: Quantitative analysis of creativity metrics
- Path B: Qualitative interviews with team members
- Path C: Mixed-methods longitudinal study
- Path D: Case study analysis of creative companies

Decision Point 2: Creativity Measurement
- Path A: Traditional creativity assessments
- Path B: Innovation output tracking
- Path C: Collaborative behavior analysis
- Path D: Employee satisfaction and engagement metrics

BACKTRACKING TRIGGERS:
- Insufficient evidence to support continued exploration
- Contradictory information that invalidates the path
- Resource constraints that make path unfeasible
- Better alternative path discovered

INTEGRATION STRATEGIES:
- Synthesis: Combine complementary insights from multiple paths
- Triangulation: Use multiple paths to validate findings
- Sequential: Use one path's output as input for another
- Parallel: Execute multiple paths simultaneously for comprehensive coverage
