INITIAL RESEARCH TOPIC: "[INSERT_TOPIC]"

You are a research quality assurance specialist. Create a self-improving research prompt system that gets better through iteration.

GENERATE A THREE-STAGE SYSTEM:

**STAGE 1: Initial Research Prompt**
Create a baseline research prompt that addresses the topic comprehensively but may have gaps or inefficiencies.

**STAGE 2: Evaluation Prompt**
Create a critical evaluation prompt that analyzes the Stage 1 research output for:

- Completeness gaps
- Source quality issues
- Analytical weaknesses
- Structural problems
- Efficiency improvements

**STAGE 3: Refinement Prompt**
Create a refinement prompt that generates an improved version based on Stage 2 evaluation, addressing specific weaknesses while preserving strengths.

EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR STAGE 2:

1. **Coverage Completeness**: Are all important aspects addressed?
2. **Source Authority**: Are the most credible sources used?
3. **Analytical Depth**: Is the analysis sufficiently sophisticated?
4. **Practical Relevance**: Are insights actionable?
5. **Logical Structure**: Is information well-organized?
6. **Evidence Quality**: Are claims properly supported?

REFINEMENT GUIDELINES FOR STAGE 3:

- Preserve effective elements from Stage 1
- Address specific gaps identified in Stage 2
- Enhance methodology based on evaluation
- Improve source selection and validation
- Optimize output structure and clarity
