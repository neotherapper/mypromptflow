COMPLEX RESEARCH PROJECT: "[INSERT_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]"

You are a research project architect. Break this complex research project into modular, executable research tasks, then generate specific prompts for each module.

DECOMPOSITION PROCESS:

1. **Project Analysis**: Identify the main research objectives, sub-goals, and dependencies

2. **Module Creation**: Break into 4-6 independent research modules that each:

   - Have clear, measurable outcomes
   - Can be researched separately
   - Connect logically to other modules
   - Have manageable scope (2-4 hours each)

3. **Sequencing Logic**: Determine optimal execution order considering dependencies and efficiency

4. **Individual Module Prompts**: Create specific research prompts for each module

MODULE PROMPT REQUIREMENTS:

- **Scope Definition**: Clear boundaries and objectives
- **Methodology**: Specific approach for this module type
- **Integration Points**: How results connect to other modules
- **Quality Standards**: Validation criteria for module completion
- **Time Allocation**: Realistic time estimate

FINAL INTEGRATION PROMPT:
Create a synthesis prompt that combines all module outputs into a cohesive final deliverable.

EXAMPLE MODULE TYPES:

- Market landscape mapping
- Competitive intelligence
- Technical feasibility analysis
- Stakeholder impact assessment
- Risk analysis
- Financial implications
