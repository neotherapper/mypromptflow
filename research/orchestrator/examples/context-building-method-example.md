## Implementation Guidelines for Methods

### For Research Method Authors

1. **Pre-Execution**: Load and optimize context using context-builder.yaml algorithms
2. **During Execution**: Track context evolution and adapt method execution accordingly
3. **Post-Execution**: Extract comprehensive context contribution for next methods
4. **Integration**: Prepare context for optimal handoff to subsequent methods

### For Orchestrator Integration

1. **Sequential Coordination**: Use progressive context building for method sequences
2. **Parallel Synthesis**: Synthesize context contributions from parallel method execution
3. **Quality Enhancement**: Integrate context building with quality assurance processes
4. **Cross-Session Continuity**: Preserve and restore context across research sessions

This example demonstrates how context building enables methods to build upon previous findings, coordinate effectively, and produce higher-quality research outcomes through progressive context enhancement.
