```json
{
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "maxTokens": 4096,
  "permissions": {
    "allowedTools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "WebSearch", "mcp__*"],
    "blockedPaths": ["sensitive-data/", "production-configs/"]
  },
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}",
    "CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT": "AI Knowledge Base System Assistant"
  }
}
```

### Priority 2: Create `.mcp.json` (1-2 hours)  
**Impact**: MCP server configuration documentation + team tool availability
