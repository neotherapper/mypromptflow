## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 1: Official Command Creation Specifications and Best Practices

### Official Command Creation Framework

**Source Authority: Anthropic Official Documentation (Confidence: Verified)**
- Primary Source: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview (Verified: 2025-07-30)
- Secondary Source: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials (Verified: 2025-07-30)
- Validation Source: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices (Verified: 2025-07-30)

#### Core Command Creation Specifications

**Custom Slash Commands Architecture:**
```markdown
Location Requirements:
- Project-specific: `.claude/commands/` directory
- Personal: `~/.claude/commands/` directory
- Priority: Project commands override personal commands
```

**File Structure Requirements (Verified):**
- Format: Markdown files (.md extension)
- Naming: Filename becomes command name (e.g., `optimize.md` → `/optimize`)
- Content: Natural language prompt templates
- Parameters: `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for dynamic input

**Command Invocation Patterns (Official Specification):**
```bash
# Project command with context indicator
/project:command-name arguments

# Personal command available globally  
/command-name arguments

# Example with parameters
/project:fix-github-issue 1234
```

#### Validated Best Practices

**Command Design Principles (Source: Anthropic Engineering Team):**
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each command should address one specific workflow
2. **Parameter Flexibility**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` for dynamic input handling
3. **Context Awareness**: Commands should leverage project-specific context
4. **Team Sharing**: Project commands enable team-wide workflow standardization

**Implementation Examples (Verified from Official Sources):**
```markdown
# Performance optimization command
echo "Analyze the performance of this code and suggest three specific optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md

# Security review command  
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### Command Validation Requirements

**Quality Validation Patterns (Source: Community Best Practices - Confidence: High):**
- Test commands with representative use cases
- Validate parameter substitution with `$ARGUMENTS`
- Ensure commands maintain context awareness
- Document command purpose and usage patterns

- Primary Source: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents (Verified: 2025-07-30)
- Community Validation: Multiple GitHub repositories with 1000+ stars (Confidence: High)

#### YAML Frontmatter Structure (Official Specification)

**Required Configuration Format:**
```yaml
---
name: agent-name-kebab-case
description: "Action-oriented description of when to use this agent"
tools: Tool1, Tool2, Tool3
---
```

**Configuration Requirements (Verified):**
- **Name Field**: Lowercase, hyphen-separated, unique identifier
- **Description Field**: Action-oriented language, proactive usage indicators
- **Tools Field**: Comma-separated list of accessible tools (optional)
- **Location Priority**: `.claude/agents/` (project) > `~/.claude/agents/` (user)

#### Automatic Delegation Patterns

**Delegation Triggers (Official Anthropic Documentation):**
1. **Task Description Matching**: Keywords in user requests trigger appropriate subagents
2. **Context-Based Selection**: Claude evaluates task complexity and domain expertise
3. **Tool Requirements**: Subagent tool permissions match task requirements
4. **Proactive Activation**: Keywords like "use PROACTIVELY" in description field

**Delegation Algorithm (Inferred from Official Sources):**
```yaml
Selection Criteria:
  - Task keyword matching against description field
  - Available tool alignment with task requirements  
  - Context window optimization
  - Subagent specialization relevance
```

#### Validated Configuration Examples

**Code Review Specialist (Community Validated):**
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: "Expert code review specialist. Use proactively for all code quality assessments."
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
---
```

**Security Auditor Pattern:**
```yaml
---
name: security-auditor  
description: "Security vulnerability specialist. Use for security reviews and threat analysis."
tools: Read, Grep, Bash
---
```

### Subagent Validation Requirements
