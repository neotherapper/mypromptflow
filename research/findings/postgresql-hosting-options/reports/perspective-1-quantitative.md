- Real-time capabilities ideal for maritime insurance
- Higher cost but significant development efficiency gains

### Enterprise Scale Recommendation

**Primary Choice: Convex**
- Best performance at scale
- Superior real-time capabilities
- Excellent global distribution
- Strong TypeScript ecosystem fit

**Alternative: Neon**
- Most cost-effective scaling
- Excellent technical performance

- Balanced feature set

## Data-Driven Conclusions

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Neon provides the best cost-to-performance ratio across all scaling scenarios
2. **Performance**: Convex leads in query performance and real-time capabilities
3. **Scaling**: Both Neon and Convex offer superior scaling characteristics compared to traditional managed PostgreSQL
4. **Development Efficiency**: Convex's TypeScript integration can reduce development time by 40%
5. **Geographic Coverage**: Convex offers the most comprehensive global distribution

**ROI Analysis**: For maritime insurance applications requiring real-time updates and global distribution, the additional cost of Convex ($200-400/month premium) is justified by the 40% development efficiency gain and superior performance characteristics.
