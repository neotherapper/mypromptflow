## Complete AI-Assisted SDLC Workflow

### Phase 1: Business Requirement Capture → JIRA Ticket Creation

#### Traditional Process Challenges
- Manual requirement translation creates communication gaps
- Ambiguous specifications lead to development rework  
- Inconsistent ticket quality affects planning accuracy
- Limited traceability between business goals and technical implementation

#### AI-Enhanced Workflow Design

**Step 1.1: Intelligent Requirement Analysis**
**Tools:** Claude Code + JIRA (via Atlassian Remote MCP Server)
**Process:**
1. Business stakeholders submit requirements in natural language
2. AI analyzes requirements for completeness and clarity using template matching
3. Automated gap identification with specific clarification requests
4. Business impact assessment with priority scoring algorithm
5. Direct JIRA integration for ticket creation and updates via MCP
**Source:** Atlassian Remote MCP Server (launched May 2025)

**VanguardAI Example - Fleet Onboarding Enhancement:**
```
Business Request: "We need to improve the fleet onboarding process for ship owners"

AI Analysis Output:
- Missing Specifications Identified:
  * Document types required (certificates, registrations, inspection reports)
  * Validation rules for each document type
  * Approval workflow and stakeholder roles
  * Integration requirements with broker systems
  * Compliance requirements for different jurisdictions

- Clarification Questions Generated:
  * What specific document validation errors are ship owners experiencing?
  * Which jurisdictions need special compliance handling?
  * What is the expected volume of concurrent onboarding requests?
  * Are there specific broker API requirements for document sharing?

- Business Impact Score: High (affects customer acquisition and retention)
- Technical Complexity Score: Medium (requires UI, backend, and integration work)
```

**Step 1.2: Automated Ticket Creation**
**Tools:** JIRA (via Atlassian Remote MCP Server) + Claude Code + Template Libraries + Estimation Models
**Process:**
1. Structured ticket generation from analyzed requirements
2. Automated task breakdown with dependency mapping
3. Effort estimation based on historical data and complexity analysis
4. Acceptance criteria generation with testable conditions
5. Direct JIRA ticket creation and updates via MCP integration
**Source:** Atlassian Remote MCP Server, Claude Code MCP capabilities

**Generated JIRA Ticket Example:**
```
Title: Enhanced Fleet Onboarding with Document Validation

  const { quotes, isLoading } = useRealTimeBrokerQuotes();
  const { ranking, recommendations } = useIntelligentPolicyRanking(quotes);
  
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
      {/* Real-time quote updates */}
      <div className="lg:col-span-2">
        <LiveQuoteStream quotes={quotes} />
      </div>
      
      {/* AI-powered recommendations */}
      <div>
        <RecommendationPanel 
          topPolicies={ranking.slice(0, 3)}
          reasoning={recommendations}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Backend (Python Flask + AI Assistance):**
```python
# AI-generated real-time quote processing system
@socketio.on('subscribe_to_quotes')
def handle_quote_subscription(data):
    """Real-time broker quote streaming with AI optimization"""
    fleet_id = data['fleet_id']
    
    # AI-optimized broker selection
    relevant_brokers = ai_broker_matcher.find_optimal_brokers(fleet_id)
    
    # Start real-time quote collection
    for broker in relevant_brokers:
        broker_service.start_quote_stream(
            broker_id=broker.id,
            fleet_id=fleet_id,
            callback=lambda quote: emit('quote_update', {
                'broker': broker.name,
                'quote': ai_quote_processor.normalize_quote(quote),
                'ranking': ai_ranking_engine.calculate_score(quote),
                'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
            })
        )
```
