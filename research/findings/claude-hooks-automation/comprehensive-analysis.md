## Executive Summary

Claude Code hooks provide a powerful automation framework for enforcing research framework compliance and automatic task list updates. The system enables deterministic control over AI assistant behavior through event-driven shell command execution, transforming manual compliance into automated workflows.

**Key Finding**: Hooks can effectively automate task list updates and research documentation compliance, but simple shell scripts are more practical than complex Python solutions for this use case.

## Research Methodology

This research utilized the multi-perspective approach enhanced with Constitutional AI validation and self-consistency verification to analyze Claude Code hooks capabilities across technical, practical, and implementation perspectives.

## Key Findings

### 1. Hook System Architecture

Claude Code hooks are **user-defined shell commands** that execute at specific lifecycle events:

- **Event-driven execution**: Triggers on PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, and Stop events
- **Shell command integration**: Direct system-level command execution with full user permissions
- **Environment variable context**: Rich contextual information (`$CLAUDE_TOOL_OUTPUT`, `$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS`, `$CLAUDE_TOOL_NAME`)
- **JSON response structure**: Structured feedback with `continue` and `stopReason` controls

### 2. Critical Events for Task Management

**PostToolUse Hooks** are most effective for automatic task list updates:

- Trigger after successful tool execution
- Access complete tool results and affected file paths
- Enable real-time task status updates based on actual work completion

**PreToolUse Hooks** provide validation capabilities:

- Enforce research framework compliance before document creation
- Validate required parameters and context
- Block execution if compliance requirements not met

### 3. Implementation Strategies

**Simple Approach** (Recommended):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple task list updater
if echo "$CLAUDE_TOOL_OUTPUT" | grep -q "research.*complete"; then
    echo "- [x] Research task completed ($(date))" >> task-list.md
fi
```

**Configuration**:

```toml
# .claude/settings.toml
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "Task"
command = "bash .claude/hooks/update-tasks.sh"
```

### 4. Research Framework Integration

Hooks can enforce the 6-step orchestrator workflow:

1. **Detection validation**: Verify research triggers match intention patterns
2. **Context validation**: Ensure required parameters are extracted
3. **Method validation**: Confirm approved research methods are used
4. **Documentation enforcement**: Require proper research findings structure
5. **Registry updates**: Automatically update research-registry.yaml
6. **Quality assurance**: Validate Constitutional AI and self-consistency compliance

### 5. Compliance Automation Capabilities

**Automatic Task Updates**:

- Mark research tasks as completed with timestamps
- Generate follow-up tasks based on research findings
- Update progress.md with research outcomes
- Maintain audit logs of all task changes

**Documentation Validation**:

- Enforce research metadata schema compliance
- Validate required directory structures
- Check for mandatory research files
- Ensure cross-references are properly maintained

# Claude Code Hooks for TypeScript Development

Claude Code hooks represent a paradigm shift from probabilistic AI behavior to deterministic automation, ensuring critical development actions always happen rather than relying on the LLM to choose to run them. **This comprehensive guide provides everything needed to implement hooks in TypeScript workflows**, from core concepts to production-ready configurations.

## Core concept: Deterministic automation over AI reasoning

Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute automatically at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. Unlike traditional prompting that depends on AI decision-making, **hooks provide guaranteed execution at defined trigger points**. This creates a hybrid approach where AI handles creative coding tasks while hooks ensure consistent quality control, testing, and compliance.

The fundamental difference lies in execution certainty. Traditional prompts like "please format this code" might be inconsistently followed, especially as context grows or the AI focuses on other tasks. Hooks guarantee that formatting happens every time a TypeScript file is modified, creating reliable development workflows that bridge AI assistance with deterministic automation.

## Technical architecture: Five lifecycle events with JSON configuration

### Hook lifecycle events

Claude Code operates on five distinct lifecycle events that provide comprehensive control over the development process:

**PreToolUse** executes before Claude uses any tool, enabling approval, blocking, or deferring to normal permission flow. This event receives tool name and input parameters, making it ideal for validation and permission enforcement. For TypeScript projects, PreToolUse hooks can block dangerous operations on production files or enforce coding standards before changes occur.

**PostToolUse** executes after successful tool completion, receiving tool output and execution context. This is the most commonly used event for TypeScript development, triggering automatic formatting, linting, type checking, and testing after code changes. The hook receives structured information about what files were modified and what tool was used.

**Notification** executes when Claude sends notifications or awaits user input, enabling custom notification systems. TypeScript developers can use this to integrate with team communication tools like Slack or create desktop notifications for build status updates.

**Stop** executes when Claude finishes generating responses, running after the main Claude Code agent completes. This event is useful for session cleanup, final processing, or triggering deployment workflows.

**SubagentStop** executes when Claude Code subagents finish delegated tasks, enabling hierarchical workflow management for complex TypeScript projects with multiple build steps or testing phases.

### Configuration structure and JSON schema

Hook configuration uses a hierarchical JSON structure with sophisticated matching capabilities:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "edit_file",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx prettier --write \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\"",
            "timeout": 60,
            "run_in_background": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The configuration hierarchy applies settings in order of precedence: Enterprise Managed Policy (`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`), User Global Settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`), Project Shared Settings (`.claude/settings.json`), and Project Local Settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`).

### Security model and execution environment

Hooks execute with full user permissions in the same environment as Claude Code, **with no sandboxing or additional security boundaries**. This means hooks can read, write, and delete any files accessible to the user account, execute system commands, and access network resources. The security model places complete responsibility on users to ensure hook commands are safe and properly validated.

Environment variables provide rich contextual information: `$CLAUDE_TOOL_NAME` contains the tool being executed, `$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS` provides space-separated file paths, and `$CLAUDE_NOTIFICATION` contains notification content. All hooks matching specific criteria run in parallel with configurable timeouts.

## TypeScript-specific implementation: SDK integration and tooling

### SDK usage patterns with @anthropic-ai/claude-code

The official TypeScript SDK provides both simple and advanced integration patterns:

```typescript
import { query, type SDKMessage } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-code";

const messages: SDKMessage[] = [];
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Write a TypeScript function with proper types",
  abortController: new AbortController(),
  options: {
    maxTurns: 3,
  },
})) {
  messages.push(message);
}
```

The fluent API pattern enables more sophisticated TypeScript integrations:

```typescript
import { claude } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-code";

const response = await claude()
  .withModel("sonnet")
  .allowTools("Read", "Write")
  .skipPermissions()
  .inDirectory("./src")
  .withTimeout(30000)
  .query("Generate TypeScript interfaces for API responses")
  .asText();
```

### Integration with TypeScript tooling

**ESLint integration** provides automatic code quality enforcement:

```toml
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["*.ts", "*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts"]
command = "npx eslint --fix $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS"
run_in_background = false
```

**Prettier integration** ensures consistent code formatting:

```toml
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["*.ts", "*.tsx", "*.js", "*.jsx"]
command = "npx prettier --write $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS"
run_in_background = false
```

**TypeScript compiler integration** provides real-time type checking:

```toml
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]
command = "npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json"
```

### TypeScript-specific type definitions

The SDK provides comprehensive type definitions for hook integration:

```typescript
interface HookEvent {
  tool: string;
  args: Record<string, any>;
  filePaths?: string[];
  exitCode?: number;
  output?: string;
}

interface ClaudeCodeOptions {
  apiKey?: string;
  model?: string;
  workingDirectory?: string;
  verbose?: boolean;
  timeout?: number;
}

interface ClaudeSettings {
  permissions?: {
    allow: string[];
    deny: string[];
  };
  env?: Record<string, string>;
  hooks?: HookConfig[];
  typescript?: {
    configPath?: string;
    strict?: boolean;
    skipLibCheck?: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Practical examples: Real-world TypeScript configurations

### Auto-formatting hooks for TypeScript files

A comprehensive formatting pipeline that runs ESLint, Prettier, and type checking:

```toml
# Combined ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript checking
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]
command = """
npx prettier --write $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS && \
npx eslint --fix $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS && \
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck
"""
```

### Test automation workflows

Automatic test execution with background processing for long-running test suites:

```toml
# Run tests after TypeScript changes
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
run_in_background = true
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["src/**/*.ts", "tests/**/*.ts"]
command = "npm run test -- --watchAll=false"

# Run specific test suites based on file location
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["src/api/**/*.ts"]
command = "npm run test -- tests/api --passWithNoTests"
run_in_background = true
```

### Type checking integration

Incremental type checking with build optimization:

```toml
# Incremental TypeScript build
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["src/**/*.ts"]
command = """
echo 'Building TypeScript project...' && \
npx tsc --build --incremental && \
echo 'TypeScript build successful!'
"""
```

### Build process hooks

Complete build pipeline with error handling:

```toml
# Production build hook
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["src/**/*.ts"]
command = """
echo 'Building TypeScript project...' && \
npm run build && \
echo 'Build completed successfully!'
"""
```

## Configuration patterns: Multi-level settings and debugging

### User vs project vs enterprise settings

**Enterprise-level configuration** provides organization-wide standards:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(npm run lint)", "Bash(npm run test:*)"],
    "deny": ["Bash(curl:*)", "Bash(rm:*)"]
  },
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "edit_file",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/opt/company/scripts/security-scan.sh \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Project-level configuration** handles team-specific TypeScript workflows:

```toml
# TypeScript project configuration
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]
command = "npm run claude:all"
```

Supporting package.json scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "claude:format": "prettier --write 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}' && eslint --fix 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'",
    "claude:typecheck": "tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck",
    "claude:build": "tsc --build --incremental",
    "claude:test": "jest --passWithNoTests",
    "claude:all": "npm run claude:format && npm run claude:typecheck && npm run claude:test"
  }
}
```

### Hook debugging and troubleshooting

**Debug mode** enables detailed hook execution visibility:

```bash
# Enable debug mode for hook troubleshooting
claude --debug
```

**Environment variable debugging** helps diagnose configuration issues:

```bash
# Log all available environment variables
command = "env | grep CLAUDE_ >> /tmp/claude_env_debug.log"
```

**Hook execution tracing** provides insight into the execution flow:

```bash
# Trace hook execution
command = "echo 'Hook start' && your_command && echo 'Hook end' || echo 'Hook failed'"
```

### MCP tool integration patterns

Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools follow the pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>` and can be targeted with specific hooks:

```toml
# Hook for MCP filesystem operations
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "mcp__filesystem__write_file"
command = "echo 'MCP filesystem write detected' >> /tmp/mcp_audit.log"
run_in_background = true

# Hook for MCP memory operations
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "mcp__memory__create_entities"
command = "./scripts/backup_memory_state.sh"
run_in_background = true
```

## Best practices: Security, performance, and reliability

### Security considerations for production use

**Input validation** is critical for preventing injection attacks:

```bash
# SECURE: Always validate and sanitize inputs
command = "if [[ '$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS' =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9/._-]+$ ]]; then black $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS; fi"

# SECURE: Always quote shell variables
command = "ruff check --fix \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\""

# SECURE: Block path traversal
command = "if [[ '$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS' != *'..'* ]]; then format_files \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\"; fi"
```

**Production file protection** prevents accidental modifications:

```toml
# Block modifications to production files
[[hooks]]
event = "PreToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["config/production/*", "*.env"]
command = "echo 'Production file modification blocked' && exit 1"
```

### Performance optimization

**Background execution** prevents blocking for long-running operations:

```toml
# Use background execution for tests
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
run_in_background = true
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
command = "npm run test:integration"
```

**Resource management** prevents system overload:

```bash
# Limit resource usage for expensive operations
command = "timeout 30s nice -n 10 eslint --fix \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\""
```

**Execution monitoring** tracks performance:

```bash
# Track hook execution time
command = "start_time=$(date +%s); black \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\"; end_time=$(date +%s); echo \"Hook execution: $((end_time - start_time))s\" >> /tmp/hook_perf.log"
```

### Error handling strategies

**Graceful failure handling** ensures workflows continue:

```bash
# Fail gracefully without breaking workflow
command = "black \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\" || echo 'Formatting failed, continuing...'"

# Exit with appropriate codes
command = "if ! npm run test; then echo 'Tests failed' && exit 1; fi"
```

**Comprehensive logging** enables troubleshooting:

```bash
# Structured logging for debugging
command = "echo \"$(date): Hook triggered for $CLAUDE_TOOL_NAME on $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\" >> ~/.claude/hook_debug.log"
```

## Conclusion

Claude Code hooks transform TypeScript development by providing deterministic automation that complements AI assistance. **The combination of guaranteed execution, sophisticated configuration options, and comprehensive TypeScript tooling integration creates powerful development workflows** that maintain code quality while leveraging AI capabilities.

Key success factors include starting with simple formatting hooks, implementing robust security validation, optimizing performance through background execution, and establishing comprehensive error handling.
