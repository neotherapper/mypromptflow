- **Cross-service search**: Unified semantic search across service boundaries

#### Enterprise Containerization Standards

**Docker Production Patterns:**
- **Isolation benefits**: Controlled environments without dependency conflicts
- **Portability advantages**: Consistent deployment across dev/test/production
- **Scalability foundation**: Container orchestration platform integration (Bluetuple AI Vector Docker Guide, 2024 [https://medium.com/bluetuple-ai/vector-databases-with-docker-a-guide-for-modern-containerized-ai-infrastructure-5592e77f8893])

**Kubernetes Production Best Practices:**
- **Namespace isolation**: Dedicated namespaces for vector database deployments
- **Resource management**: CPU/RAM limits using containerSpec resources property
- **Health monitoring**: Readiness and liveness probes for container lifecycle management
- **Distributed topology**: Vector agents on all cluster nodes for data collection (Vector Kubernetes Documentation, 2025 [https://vector.dev/docs/setup/installation/platforms/kubernetes/])

### Production Deployment Architectures
