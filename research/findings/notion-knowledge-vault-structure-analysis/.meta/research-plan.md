# Research Plan: User's Notion Knowledge Vault Structure Analysis

## Research Topic
Analyze the user's existing Notion "Developer Command Center Knowledge Vault" to understand database organization, relationships, and tag-based categorization for accurate file-based replication.

## Session Information
- **Session ID**: notion-knowledge-vault-structure-2025-07-21
- **Start Time**: 2025-07-21T21:15:00Z
- **AI Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4
- **Duration Target**: 2-4 hours
- **Research Type**: Structure Analysis + User Requirements Mapping

## Context Analysis
- **Complexity Level**: Moderate (database structure analysis)
- **Domain**: Knowledge Management System Design
- **Quality Requirements**: High (foundation for file-based implementation)
- **User Requirements**: Replicate Notion structure in files with relationships

## Method Selection
- **Primary Method**: User Requirements Analysis + Structure Mapping
- **Approach**: 
  1. Document inferred structure from user descriptions
  2. Create schema mapping for file-based implementation
  3. Design relationship patterns and navigation flows
  4. Validate assumptions with user feedback

## Research Approach
### Phase 1: Requirements Documentation (30 min)
- Map user's described structure (languages, tools-services, platform-sites)
- Document relationship patterns and navigation preferences
- Identify key organizational features (tags, categories, cross-references)

### Phase 2: Schema Design (60 min)
- Create YAML schema definitions for each database
- Map property types and relationship structures
- Design file organization matching Notion patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning (45 min)
- Define directory structure and file naming conventions
- Plan cross-reference system using @ syntax
- Design tag-based filtering and categorization

### Phase 4: Validation Framework (30 min)
- Create questions for user validation
- Plan iterative refinement process
- Define success criteria for structure accuracy

## Quality Validation
- **Structural Accuracy**: Schema matches user's described organization
- **Relationship Integrity**: Cross-database connections preserved
- **Navigation Parity**: File-based system enables same discovery patterns
- **Tag Functionality**: Category filtering works as described

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete schema definitions for all databases
- File-based directory structure design
- Relationship mapping and cross-reference system
- Implementation roadmap for file-based knowledge vault

## Success Criteria
- User confirms schema accuracy matches Notion structure
- File organization enables same navigation patterns
- Tag-based filtering replicates Notion category views
- Implementation plan is clear and actionable
