- Business relevance assessment based on explicit capability analysis
- Production readiness evaluation using established criteria from previous research

**Completeness Assurance:**
- Comprehensive coverage of both target repositories achieved
- Integration with existing research provides complete ecosystem view
- Strategic gap analysis identifies areas not covered by current ecosystem
- Business application assessment ensures practical relevance
