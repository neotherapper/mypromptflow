research_intent_detection:
  trigger_analysis:
    user_request: "evaluate the @ai framework in regard to @research/findings/business-documentation-framework/business-documentation-for-ai-assisted-app-development.md . i want to check that all important documents can be created. i want to evaluate that their dependencies make sense. do we miss any documents that when given to an ai agent it will help create features for a web application for a business idea? i want to make sure that all workflow works. so the plan is that we generate all documentation that is needed. then we create feature folders that have all necessary information inside. then when an ai agent will start work on a feature it can reference this to take the best action. i am also interested in researching on some documentation like the ui/ux. what kind of documents can give the best results?"
