# PR Validation Workflow
name: AI-Powered PR Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  ai-validation:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude') || github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          max_turns: 3
          timeout_minutes: 10
```

**Container-Based Execution Patterns:**
