# Perspective 1: Technical Implementation Architecture

## Claude Code Integration Patterns

### GitHub Actions Integration
- **Official Claude Code Action**: Beta release with comment-triggered workflows
- **Authentication Methods**: Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Parallel execution with result synthesis
- **Container Support**: Docker-based execution environments

### Event-Driven Architecture
```yaml
# Webhook-based PR validation
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
```

### API Integration Patterns
- **GitHub REST API**: PR data retrieval, status updates, review management
- **Claude Code CLI**: Direct command-line integration within runners
- **Webhook Processing**: Real-time event handling with sub-second response

### Container Execution Strategies
- **Service Containers**: Database/cache dependencies for testing
- **GPU Runners**: Computationally intensive AI workloads
- **Custom Images**: Pre-configured AI environments

## Implementation Approaches

### Webhook vs Polling
**Webhook (Recommended):**
- Real-time processing with immediate response
- Resource efficient event-driven execution
- Horizontal scaling through distribution

**Polling (Fallback):**
- Reliable processing during webhook failures
- Simpler implementation and debugging
- Built-in rate limiting protection

### Multi-Runner Distribution
- Load balancing across GitHub Actions runners
- External processing for intensive tasks
- Queue management for high-volume scenarios

### Configuration Management
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project-specific guidelines and rules
- **Repository Secrets**: Secure API key storage
- **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration options
