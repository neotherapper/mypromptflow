----------------------------|------------|----------------|-------------
No Nx (full builds)        | 18 min     | $0.130        | $85.80
Nx without cache           | 7 min      | $0.052        | $34.32
Nx with cache (70% hit)    | 3 min      | $0.022        | $14.52
Nx with cache (85% hit)    | 2 min      | $0.015        | $9.90
```

### 1.4 Database Cost Comparison

#### Ephemeral PostgreSQL vs Shared Staging
```
Ephemeral Database per Environment:
- Railway: $0.60 per day
- AWS RDS: $0.85 per day
- Pros: Complete isolation, parallel testing
- Cons: Higher costs, slower startup

Shared Staging Database:
- Railway: $0.15 per day per environment
- AWS RDS: $0.25 per day per environment
- Pros: Lower costs, faster startup
- Cons: Potential conflicts, data cleanup needed
```

#### Hybrid Approach Optimization
```
Strategy: 80% shared database, 20% ephemeral
- Shared database environments: $0.15 per day
- Ephemeral database environments: $0.60 per day
- Blended cost: (0.8 × $0.15) + (0.2 × $0.60) = $0.24 per day
- Savings: 60% compared to full ephemeral approach
```

### 1.5 Total Cost per Ephemeral Environment

#### Railway + Vercel Stack (Recommended)
```
Daily Cost Breakdown:
- Railway (FastAPI + DB): $0.237
- Vercel (React frontend): $0.67
- Total per environment: $0.907 per day
- Monthly cost: $27.21 per environment

```

## 2. Cost Optimization Strategies

### 2.1 Auto-scaling and Idle Detection

#### Intelligent Resource Management
```python
# Auto-scaling configuration for Railway
class ResourceOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.idle_threshold = 300  # 5 minutes
        self.scale_down_factor = 0.3
        self.scale_up_delay = 60  # 1 minute
    
    async def optimize_resources(self, environment_id: str):
        """Optimize resources based on usage patterns"""
        usage = await self.get_usage_metrics(environment_id)
        
        if usage.idle_time > self.idle_threshold:
            # Scale down to 30% of normal resources
            await self.scale_resources(environment_id, self.scale_down_factor)
            return f"Scaled down environment {environment_id}"
        
        if usage.cpu_utilization > 80:
            # Scale up resources
            await self.scale_resources(environment_id, 1.5)
            return f"Scaled up environment {environment_id}"
```

#### Cost Impact of Auto-scaling
```
Without Auto-scaling:
- 24/7 full resource allocation
- Daily cost: $0.907 per environment

With Auto-scaling (60% idle time):
- Active hours: 8 hours at 100% resources
- Idle hours: 16 hours at 30% resources
- Daily cost: (8 × $0.907) + (16 × $0.907 × 0.3) = $11.61
- Savings: 35% cost reduction
```

### 2.2 Build Caching Strategies with Nx

#### Multi-layer Caching Implementation
```typescript
// nx.json optimized configuration
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "nx-cloud",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "test", "lint", "docker-build"],
        "parallel": 3,
        "accessToken": "nx-cloud-token",
        "encryptionKey": "encryption-key",
        "cacheDirectory": "/tmp/nx-cache"
      }
    }
  },
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "cache": true,
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "inputs": [
        "default",
        "^default",
        "{workspaceRoot}/.env",
        "{workspaceRoot}/package.json"
      ],
      "outputs": ["{options.outputPath}"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Caching Cost Benefits
```
Build Caching Impact:
- Cache hit rate: 75% (after initial builds)
- Build time reduction: 80%
- Cost per build: $0.052 → $0.010
- Monthly savings: $24.68 per environment
- Annual savings: $296.16 per environment
```

### 2.3 Resource Sharing vs Isolation Trade-offs

#### Shared Resource Strategy

# Docker Compose with shared services
version: '3.8'
services:
  shared-postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=vanguard_shared
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  
  shared-redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
  
  app-env-1:
    depends_on: [shared-postgres, shared-redis]
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@shared-postgres:5432/vanguard_shared
      - REDIS_URL=redis://shared-redis:6379/1
  
  app-env-2:
    depends_on: [shared-postgres, shared-redis]
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@shared-postgres:5432/vanguard_shared
      - REDIS_URL=redis://shared-redis:6379/2
```

#### Cost Impact Analysis
```
Isolated Resources:
- Database cost per environment: $0.60
- Redis cost per environment: $0.15
- Total for 10 environments: $7.50 per day

Shared Resources:
- Shared database cost: $1.20 per day (larger instance)

            "devops": 200
        }
        self.cost_per_environment = 27.21  # Monthly cost
    
    def calculate_team_allocation(self, team: str, environments: int):
        """Calculate cost allocation for team"""
        total_cost = environments * self.cost_per_environment
        budget = self.team_budgets.get(team, 0)
        
        return {
            "team": team,
            "environments": environments,
            "monthly_cost": total_cost,
            "budget": budget,
            "budget_utilization": (total_cost / budget) * 100,
            "remaining_budget": budget - total_cost
        }
```
