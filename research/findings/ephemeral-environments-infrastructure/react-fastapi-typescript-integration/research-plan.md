# Research Plan

## Research Topic
React/FastAPI Integration Patterns with TypeScript Generation for Full-Stack Type Safety

## Session Information
- Session ID: research_session_20250109_140000
- Started: 2025-01-09T14:00:00Z
- Duration: 2h 30m
- AI Agent: claude-4-research-agent

## Research Context Analysis
- **Complexity Level**: Complex
- **Domain Type**: Cross-domain (web frontend, backend APIs, build tools, insurance domain)
- **Quality Requirements**: High
- **Research Scope**: Broad

## Orchestrator Method Selection
- **Primary Methods**: multi_perspective_approach
- **Enhancement Methods**: constitutional_ai, self_consistency
- **Execution Pattern**: multi_agent
- **Selection Reasoning**: Complex cross-domain research requires specialized sub-agents for comprehensive coverage of React ecosystem, Python backend, TypeScript tooling, monorepo architecture, and insurance domain specifics

## Research Approach

### Initial Plan
1. **Deploy Specialized Sub-Agents**: Create six specialized research agents for each domain area:
   - TypeScript Generation Specialist
   - API Client Management Specialist
   - Nx Monorepo Integration Specialist
   - Development Workflow Specialist
   - Insurance Domain Specialist
   - Testing and Validation Specialist

2. **Parallel Research Execution**: Execute comprehensive research across all domain areas simultaneously, leveraging current 2025 best practices and official documentation

3. **Domain-Specific Analysis**: Each specialist focuses on their area of expertise:
   - Automatic TypeScript generation from FastAPI OpenAPI schemas
   - API client generation and management patterns
   - Shared type libraries in Nx monorepo environments
   - Real-time development workflow optimization
   - Insurance platform specific patterns and domain models
   - End-to-end type safety validation and testing

4. **Findings Synthesis**: Integrate all specialist findings into a comprehensive analysis document with consistent recommendations and implementation guidance

5. **Quality Validation**: Apply constitutional AI and self-consistency checks throughout the research process

### Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive analysis of React/FastAPI Integration Patterns with TypeScript Generation for Full-Stack Type Safety
- High quality validated findings with actionable implementation guidance
- Actionable insights and recommendations for the platform insurance platform
- Integration-ready knowledge for AI knowledge base
- Specific configuration examples and code snippets
- Performance considerations and developer experience optimizations
- 2025 best practices and tool recommendations

## Quality Validation
- Constitutional AI compliance for ethical research practices
- Self-consistency verification across all specialist findings
- Methodological rigor assessment through multi-agent validation
- Bias detection and mitigation through diverse source analysis
- Technical accuracy validation against official documentation
- Completeness validation ensuring all required research areas are covered

## Research Execution Strategy
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Use Claude Code's ability to spawn specialized sub-agents for parallel execution
- **Source Diversification**: Leverage multiple authoritative sources including official documentation, industry best practices, and 2025 technology trends
- **Insurance Domain Focus**: Tailor all recommendations for insurance platform requirements
- **Performance Optimization**: Emphasize build performance, developer experience, and type safety
- **Implementation Readiness**: Provide practical configuration examples and implementation timelines
