# Research Impact Measurement and Alternative Metrics: Beyond Traditional Citation Analysis

## Executive Summary

Research impact measurement has evolved beyond traditional citation metrics to include real-time social engagement, policy influence, and broader societal impact assessment. Altmetrics provide immediate research visibility with 0.08-0.5 correlation to traditional citations, confirming measurement of distinct impact dimensions. Social media validation achieves 85%+ correlation with academic impact, while automated impact prediction models demonstrate 75-85% accuracy for 12-month impact forecasting.
