## Aggregation Architecture Patterns

### Google News: Algorithmic Supremacy with Editorial Interest

**Architecture Overview:**
Google News operates on a unique algorithm separate from traditional Google Search, focusing on freshness, authority, and aggregate editorial interest rather than PageRank signals.

**Core Components:**
- **Story Clustering System:** Groups individual articles into "story clusters" representing different angles of news events
- **Freshness-First Ranking:** Prioritizes new content exclusively, unlike Google Discover which includes older relevant content
- **Authority Assessment:** Measures publication authority within specific topics rather than general domain authority
- **Aggregate Editorial Interest:** Analyzes what editors collectively feature on front pages to drive story ranking

**Technical Implementation:**
```yaml
google_news_architecture:
  content_discovery:
    - publisher_partnerships: "Direct content submission via Publisher Center"
    - automated_crawling: "Continuous web crawling for news content"
    - submission_verification: "Publisher identity verification and ownership validation"
  
  story_clustering:
    algorithm: "Proprietary clustering based on content similarity and temporal proximity"
    cluster_formation: "Multiple articles grouped by event and perspective"
    ranking_within_cluster: "Individual story ranking within each cluster"
  
  ranking_signals:
    primary_factors:
      - freshness: "Time since publication (highest weight)"
      - authority: "Publication credibility in specific topic domains"
      - editorial_interest: "Aggregate editorial coverage analysis"
      - geographic_relevance: "Location-based content prioritization"
    
    personalization:
      - user_language_region: "Automatic language and location-based filtering"
      - interaction_history: "Click-through and engagement patterns"
      - topic_preferences: "Inferred interest categories"
```

**Scalability Metrics:**
- Processes millions of articles daily from thousands of publishers
- Real-time clustering with sub-second latency for breaking news
- Global editorial coverage analysis across 50+ languages
- Automated quality filtering removing low-credibility sources

### Apple News: Human-Algorithmic Hybrid Excellence
