- **Cost Uncertainty**: Usage-based pricing creates anxiety about experiment and learning costs
- **Context Length**: Limitations requiring task isolation and focused execution strategies
- **Learning Curve**: Initial productivity regression after completing "low-hanging fruit" tasks

**Market and Competitive Pressures**:
- **API Access Restrictions**: Anthropic cutting off third-party access (Windsurf case) creates ecosystem uncertainty
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Aggressive pricing strategies from competitors (Google's free-tier) force market repositioning
- **Vendor Lock-in Concerns**: Enterprise hesitation due to platform dependency and data portability

**Skills and Workflow Disruption**:
- **Mentorship Impact**: Concerns about reduced learning opportunities for junior developers
- **Technical Debt Risk**: Historical skepticism about AI-generated code quality
- **Workflow Integration**: Resistance to changing established development processes
