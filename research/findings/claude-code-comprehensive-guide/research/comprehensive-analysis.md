### Command Interface Modes

The CLI interface provides multiple interaction modes optimized for different development scenarios:

```bash
# Interactive REPL for complex development tasks
claude "help me refactor this user authentication flow"

# Direct query for specific problems
claude -p "why is this React component causing memory leaks?"

# Continuous conversation for iterative development
claude -c  # Resumes previous development session

# Project-specific memory and context
claude --memory-file .claude/project-context.md
```

### Security and Privacy Model

For development teams, Claude Code's security model provides important considerations:

- **Code Transmission**: Source code is sent to Anthropic's API for processing
- **Local Execution**: All commands execute within developer's local environment
- **Session Management**: Conversations persist across sessions for continued development
- **Permission Model**: Operates within existing file system permissions
- **Hook Security**: Hooks execute with full user permissions, requiring careful validation

## 2. Sub-Agents: Context Isolation Revolution

### The Context Pollution Problem Solved

Sub-agents represent a **fundamental evolution in AI-assisted development**, moving from monolithic AI assistants to specialized, collaborative AI team members. The core innovation is **context isolation**: each sub-agent operates with independent context windows, solving the critical "context pollution" problem.

**Traditional Approach (Context Pollution)**:
```
Main Conversation: Discussing React architecture patterns
↓
Debugging Task: Investigate specific memory leak
↓ 
Context Contamination: Architecture discussion mixed with debug details
↓
Result: Lost focus, cluttered conversation, reduced effectiveness
```

**Sub-Agent Approach (Context Isolation)**:
```
Main Conversation: React architecture patterns (preserved)
     ↓
Sub-Agent: Debug memory leak (isolated context)
     ↓
Clean Results: Debug findings returned without contamination
     ↓
Result: Maintained focus, clear separation, enhanced productivity
```

### Sub-Agent Architecture

    D --> G[Independent Context Window]
    E --> H[Results Report Back]
    F --> H
    G --> H
    H --> A
```

**Revolutionary Features:**
- **Independent Context Windows**: Each sub-agent maintains dedicated 200k-token context space
- **Parallel Processing**: Up to 10 concurrent sub-agents can execute simultaneously
- **Zero Context Pollution**: Sub-agent work never contaminates parent or sibling conversations
- **Specialized Configuration**: Task-specific system prompts, tool access, and behavioral parameters

### Sub-Agent Configuration

Sub-agents use **Markdown files with YAML frontmatter** configuration:

```markdown
---
name: security-code-reviewer
description: "Expert security code review specialist for identifying vulnerabilities, security anti-patterns, and compliance issues. Invoke for security-focused code analysis, penetration testing insights, and secure coding recommendations."
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebSearch
priority: high
environment: production
team: security
---

# Security Code Review Specialist

You are an expert security code reviewer with deep knowledge of:

## Core Expertise
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies
- Secure coding practices across languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go)
- Authentication and authorization security patterns
- Input validation and sanitization techniques
- Cryptography implementation best practices
- Infrastructure security configurations

## Review Process
1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identify security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential impact and likelihood of security issues
3. **Mitigation Recommendations**: Provide specific, actionable security improvements
4. **Compliance Validation**: Ensure adherence to security standards (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)

Focus on practical, implementable security improvements that balance security with maintainability.
```

### Storage Architecture

**Two-Tier Sub-Agent System:**

```
# Global Sub-Agents (User-Level)
~/.claude/agents/
├── security-code-reviewer.md
├── performance-optimizer.md
├── test-generator.md
└── documentation-specialist.md

# Project Sub-Agents (Project-Level)
.claude/agents/
├── domain-expert-insurance.md
├── legacy-system-specialist.md
└── deployment-coordinator.md
```

**Precedence Rules**: Project-level sub-agents take precedence over user-level sub-agents when names conflict.

### Usage Patterns

**Automatic Delegation**:
```
User: "Please review this authentication code for security vulnerabilities"

Claude: "I'll delegate this security review to our security specialist sub-agent..."
↓
[Automatically invokes security-code-reviewer sub-agent]
↓
[Returns comprehensive security analysis]
```

**Parallel Sub-Agent Coordination**:
```
User: "Prepare this feature for production deployment"

Claude orchestrates:
├── security-code-reviewer → Security analysis
├── performance-optimizer → Performance review  
├── test-generator → Test coverage validation
└── deployment-coordinator → Release preparation

All sub-agents execute in parallel, each in isolated contexts
```

## 3. Hooks Automation System

### From Probabilistic to Deterministic

Claude Code hooks represent a paradigm shift from **probabilistic AI behavior to deterministic automation**, ensuring critical development actions always happen rather than relying on the LLM to choose to run them.

**Core Concept**: User-defined shell commands that execute automatically at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle, providing guaranteed execution at defined trigger points.

### Hook Lifecycle Events

**Five Distinct Lifecycle Events:**

1. **PreToolUse**: Executes before Claude uses any tool, enabling validation and permission enforcement
2. **PostToolUse**: Executes after successful tool completion, most commonly used for automated formatting, linting, and testing
3. **Notification**: Executes when Claude sends notifications, enabling custom notification systems
4. **Stop**: Executes when Claude finishes generating responses, useful for session cleanup
5. **SubagentStop**: Executes when sub-agents finish delegated tasks, enabling hierarchical workflow management

### Configuration Architecture

**Hierarchical JSON Structure:**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "edit_file",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx prettier --write \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS\"",
            "timeout": 60,
            "run_in_background": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Configuration Hierarchy** (order of precedence):
1. Enterprise Managed Policy (`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`)
2. User Global Settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
3. Project Shared Settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
4. Project Local Settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)

### Development Workflow Integration

**TypeScript Development Pipeline:**

```toml
# Combined ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript checking
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]
command = """
npx prettier --write $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS && \
npx eslint --fix $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS && \
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck
"""
```

**Test Automation:**

```toml
# Run tests after TypeScript changes
[[hooks]]
event = "PostToolUse"
run_in_background = true
[hooks.matcher]
tool_name = "edit_file"
file_paths = ["src/**/*.ts", "tests/**/*.ts"]
command = "npm run test -- --watchAll=false"
