## Session Information
- Session ID: 3
- Started: 2025-07-06
- Duration: In-progress
- AI Agent: Gemini

## Research Context Analysis
- **Complexity Level**: High
- **Domain Type**: Software Engineering, AI Development
- **Quality Requirements**: High, Comprehensive
- **Research Scope**: A deep dive into the Google Gemini CLI, covering its features, best practices, community usage patterns, and advanced topics. The research should be actionable for developers using the CLI.

## Orchestrator Method Selection
- **Primary Methods**: Multi-perspective Analysis, Step-by-step, Comparative Analysis
- **Enhancement Methods**: Iterative Refinement, Self-Correction
- **Execution Pattern**: Parallelized
- **Selection Reasoning**: The complexity of the topic requires a multi-faceted approach. Step-by-step will provide a foundational understanding, multi-perspective will broaden the context, and comparative analysis will place it against existing tools. Iterative refinement and self-correction will be used to ensure the research is comprehensive and accurate.

## Research Approach

### Initial Plan
1.  **Foundation and Installation:** Detail the installation process, authentication methods, and basic configuration.
2.  **Core Functionality Deep Dive:** Systematically explore each core feature, including interactive chat, file system operations (`@`, `!`), context management, and non-interactive usage.
3.  **Best Practices and Workflow Integration:** Research and document best practices for effective use, including the `GEMINI.md` file, workflow automation, and IDE integration.
4.  **Community Usage Patterns and Use Cases:** Investigate how the community is using the Gemini CLI in practice. This will involve searching forums, blogs, and social media for real-world examples, tips, and creative use cases.
5.  **Advanced Topics:** Explore advanced features like multimodal capabilities and MCP (Model Context Servers) integrations.
6.  **Comparative Analysis:** Conduct a detailed comparative analysis against other popular AI CLIs like Aider and GitHub Copilot CLI, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.
7.  **Synthesis and Deliverable Generation:** Consolidate all findings into the required research deliverables, following the structure of the `ai-agent-failure-patterns` example.

### Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive and actionable guide to the Google Gemini CLI.
- A clear understanding of its place in the AI development tool ecosystem.
- A set of well-structured and framework-compliant research deliverables.

## Quality Validation
- Constitutional AI compliance
- Self-consistency verification
- Methodological rigor assessment
- Bias detection and mitigation
