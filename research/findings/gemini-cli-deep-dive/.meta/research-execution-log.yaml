  user_request: "you were confused because in this project i use the gemini cli, but indeed its a general-purpose gemini cli. i also asked you to find all info possible, for example tips on how to use it. how other people use it, best practices. your research was too shallow. also provide suggestions for more research if you find information. evaluate as well if your research documents that you added in gemini-cli are what it is expected. if not provide a plan on how to update the research system so that you gemini cli are able to understand better the guidelines"
