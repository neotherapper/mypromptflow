  key_discoveries:
    - "Sub-agents use Markdown files with YAML frontmatter"
    - "Support both global (~/.claude/agents/) and project-level (.claude/agents/) configuration"
    - "Each sub-agent operates in isolated context window"
    - "Parallel execution capability up to 10 concurrent sub-agents"
    - "Significant difference from Task tool approach through context isolation"
    - "Token usage increases proportionally with parallel usage"
