# Research Plan

## Research Topic
News Aggregation Platforms for AI Knowledge Intelligence Orchestrator

## Session Information
- Session ID: news-aggregation-research-20250727
- Started: 2025-07-27 (ongoing)
- Duration: Estimated 180-240 minutes
- AI Agent: Claude Sonnet 4 Multi-Agent Research Orchestrator

## Research Context Analysis
- **Complexity Level**: Complex (emerging domain, cross-platform analysis, AI integration requirements)
- **Domain Type**: Cross-domain (news aggregation + AI + technical implementation)
- **Quality Requirements**: Critical (constitutional AI compliance, 95%+ accuracy required)
- **Research Scope**: Broad (Google News, Apple News, Microsoft News, Feedly, Flipboard, RSS/Atom, credibility frameworks)

## Orchestrator Method Selection
- **Primary Methods**: multi_perspective_approach (comprehensive coverage, expert differentiation)
- **Enhancement Methods**: constitutional_ai (ethical validation), self_consistency (reliability validation)
- **Execution Pattern**: Hybrid (parallel expert analysis, sequential synthesis)
- **Selection Reasoning**: Complex cross-domain topic requiring multiple expert perspectives with rigorous quality validation

## Research Approach
