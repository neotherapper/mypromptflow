# Research Plan: Nx MCP Server and AI Integration

## Research Objective

Investigate Nx Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration and AI development workflow capabilities for the VanguardAI maritime insurance platform using Nx v20+ monorepo architecture.

## Method Selection

**Method**: Basic Web Research + Comprehensive Analysis
**Rationale**: Official documentation and recent blog posts available for Nx MCP integration

## Scope Boundaries

**In Scope**:
- Nx MCP server setup and configuration
- VS Code Copilot integration features
- AI development workflow enhancements
- Nx v20+ AI-specific capabilities
- VanguardAI maritime project integration benefits

**Out of Scope**:
- Alternative MCP server implementations
- Non-Nx monorepo AI integrations
- Detailed implementation coding

## Research Questions

1. How does Nx MCP server enhance AI development workflows?
2. What specific features does Nx Console VS Code extension provide for AI integration?
3. What are the key Nx v20+ features that benefit AI-assisted development?
4. How can these integrations benefit the VanguardAI maritime insurance platform?

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive understanding of Nx MCP capabilities
- Clear implementation recommendations
- Specific benefits for maritime domain-driven architecture
- Integration with existing VanguardAI infrastructure decisions

## Execution Plan

1. Research Nx MCP server documentation and blog posts
2. Investigate Nx Console VS Code extension AI features
3. Analyze Nx v20+ enhancements for AI development
4. Synthesize findings with VanguardAI project requirements
5. Provide implementation recommendations and next steps
