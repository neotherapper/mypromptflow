- **Contrastive Learning Integration**: Advanced implementations combine "Graph Structure Aware Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Incremental Learning"

#### ELIA-Specific Implementation Patterns
For ELIA's context recommendation system, research indicates three primary implementation approaches:

**1. GraphSAIL-Based Context Learning**:
```yaml

### 3. Contextual Memory Systems for Project-Specific Learning

#### Memory Architecture Evolution (2024-2025)
Research reveals a fundamental shift in AI memory systems, with the emergence of **Contextual Memory Intelligence (CMI)** as "a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems" that "repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making."

**Four-Tier Memory System Architecture**:
1. **Working Memory**: Active reasoning within current context window

### 6. Git Worktree Architecture Optimization for Learning Systems

#### Git Worktree Benefits for AI Learning
Research reveals that git worktree architecture provides unique advantages for AI learning systems: "Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches into separate physical directories, all linked to the same repository. Each directory maintains complete isolation while sharing the same Git history."

**Key Advantages for Learning Systems**:
- **Parallel AI Coding**: "Powerful workflow combining git worktrees with AI agents that can transform how to tackle parallel development tasks"
- **Context Preservation**: "Git worktrees solve this by letting you run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel, each with its own isolated context"
- **Independent Testing**: "Run tests in one tree while developing in another" enables safe learning experimentation
- **Reduced Context Switching**: "No context switching: Each worktree maintains its own state"

#### Learning-Optimized Worktree Architecture
Research indicates that successful implementations use git worktrees to enable "parallel AI coding workflows" where "each agent works independently on its own branch, producing different implementations of the same specification."

**ELIA Worktree Learning Design**:
```yaml
elia_worktree_learning:
  learning_isolation:
    context_separation: "per_worktree_learning_state"
