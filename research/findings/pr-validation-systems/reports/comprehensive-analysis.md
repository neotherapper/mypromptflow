}

const VALIDATION_RULES = {
  typescript: ['eslint', 'tsc', 'security-scan'],
  python: ['bandit', 'safety', 'pylint', 'mypy'],
  documentation: ['markdown-lint', 'link-check', 'spell-check'],
  tests: ['coverage-analysis', 'test-quality', 'performance-check'],
  security_sensitive: ['comprehensive-security', 'compliance-check']
}
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Performance Risk Mitigation

**Caching Strategy**: Implement multi-level caching for dependency analysis, common code patterns, and unchanged file validation results.

**Timeout Management**: Configure progressive timeouts with circuit breaker patterns to handle validation failures gracefully.

**Resource Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling validation infrastructure to handle peak PR submission periods.

#### 2. Security Risk Mitigation

**Sandbox Isolation**: Execute all validation in isolated environments to prevent malicious code execution.

**Secret Protection**: Ensure validation processes never expose secrets or sensitive information in logs or feedback.

**Access Control**: Implement fine-grained permissions for validation system access and configuration.

#### 3. Developer Experience Risk Mitigation

**Gradual Rollout**: Implement feature flags for gradual validation system deployment and rollback capability.

**Feedback Loops**: Establish continuous feedback collection and rapid iteration based on developer input.

**Override Mechanisms**: Provide escape hatches for critical changes that need to bypass normal validation.

### Future-Oriented Strategic Insights

#### Emerging Technology Integration

**Large Language Model Integration**: Next-generation validation systems will leverage specialized code-understanding LLMs for deeper semantic analysis and natural language feedback generation.

**Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning models will predict validation failures and suggest preventive measures based on historical patterns and developer behavior.

**Autonomous Remediation**: Advanced AI agents will automatically implement fixes for common issues, creating PR updates with validated solutions.

#### Scalability Evolution

**Multi-Repository Orchestration**: Future systems will coordinate validation across repository boundaries, understanding cross-project dependencies and impact.

**Global Policy Management**: Centralized policy engines will enable consistent validation rules across organizations while allowing project-specific customization.

**Intelligent Resource Allocation**: Dynamic resource allocation will optimize validation performance based on PR priority, team velocity, and resource availability.
