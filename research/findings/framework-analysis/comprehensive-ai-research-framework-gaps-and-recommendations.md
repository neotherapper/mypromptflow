# Comprehensive AI Research Framework Gaps and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

After conducting systematic research using complex research decomposition, iterative research refinement, and modular task decomposition methodologies, this analysis identifies **seven critical gaps** in the existing AI research framework and provides actionable implementation recommendations.

**Current State**: The existing framework includes meta-prompting orchestrator (15 techniques), basic three-stage research workflow (Exploration-Development-Synthesis), and task management systems.

**Critical Finding**: While the meta-prompting orchestrator provides excellent method selection capabilities, **fundamental infrastructure for validation, quality assurance, and production deployment is missing**.
