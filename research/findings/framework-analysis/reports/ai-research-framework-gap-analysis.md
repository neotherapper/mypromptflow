### Sequencing Logic

**Phase 1 (Parallel)**: Modules 1, 2, 4

- Can be researched independently
- Provide foundational understanding
- Lower interdependency

**Phase 2 (Sequential)**: Module 3, then Module 5

- Integration patterns inform collaboration design
- Module 5 depends on understanding from Module 3

**Phase 3 (Final)**: Module 6

- Builds on insights from all previous modules
- Requires comprehensive understanding for effective error handling

### Integration Synthesis Framework

**Final Integration Objectives:**

1. Synthesize all module findings into comprehensive gap analysis
2. Prioritize gaps based on impact, feasibility, and dependencies
3. Create unified implementation roadmap
4. Develop quality metrics for measuring framework completeness
5. Establish validation protocols for framework effectiveness

**Integration Methodology:**

- Cross-reference findings across modules for consistency
- Identify overlapping recommendations and consolidate
- Map dependencies between different framework components
- Validate recommendations against existing meta-prompting orchestrator
- Create actionable implementation plan with timelines and resources

## Next Steps

1. Execute modules in planned sequence
2. Document findings with evidence and sources
3. Synthesize results into unified framework enhancement plan
4. Validate recommendations through expert review
5. Create implementation roadmap with measurable milestones
