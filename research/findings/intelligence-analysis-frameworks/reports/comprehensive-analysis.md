## 1. Intelligence Community Source Assessment Methodologies

### 1.1 Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) Framework

#### Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)
**Purpose:** Systematic evaluation of multiple competing explanations for observed data
**Intelligence Community Application:** Developed by CIA veteran Richards Heuer for analytical rigor enhancement

**Core ACH Process:**
1. **Hypothesis Formation:** Identify mutually exclusive explanations for available evidence
2. **Evidence Matrix Construction:** List all relevant information, evidence, and assumptions
3. **Consistency Assessment:** Mark each hypothesis-evidence intersection as Consistent/Inconsistent/Not Applicable
4. **Critical Evidence Identification:** Highlight compelling or contradictory evidence
5. **Hypothesis Elimination:** Remove explanations lacking evidentiary support
6. **Likelihood Assessment:** Rank remaining hypotheses by evidence strength
7. **Dependency Analysis:** Evaluate conclusion robustness against critical information

**AI Orchestrator Integration Pattern:**
```yaml
ach_assessment_workflow:
  step_1_hypothesis_generation:
    process: "Generate competing explanations for information source reliability"
    inputs: ["source_history", "access_patterns", "content_analysis", "behavioral_indicators"]
    outputs: ["reliability_hypotheses", "confidence_scores"]
  
  step_2_evidence_matrix:
    process: "Cross-reference evidence against each hypothesis"
    validation_criteria:
      - historical_accuracy: "Weight: 0.3"
      - access_verification: "Weight: 0.25"
      - content_consistency: "Weight: 0.2"
      - behavioral_patterns: "Weight: 0.15"
      - external_corroboration: "Weight: 0.1"
  
  step_3_hypothesis_scoring:
    algorithm: "Weighted evidence consistency calculation"
    threshold: "Minimum 70% consistency for hypothesis retention"
    output: "Ranked source reliability assessment with confidence intervals"
```

**Effectiveness Metrics:** SATs reduce analytical errors by 25-40% and improve hypothesis testing accuracy to 90-95% in controlled studies.
