# AI Research Framework

## Purpose

This folder contains structured research conducted by AI agents to improve the knowledge base and development capabilities of the project.

## Structure

```
research/
├── README.md              # This file - framework documentation
├── metadata-schema.yaml   # Schema for research document metadata
├── findings/              # Research results and analysis
│   ├── taskmaster/        # Taskmaster AI tool research
│   └── task-management/   # General task management tools research
├── templates/             # Templates for research documents
└── tools/                 # Research validation and processing tools
```

## Research Document Standards

All research documents must include:

1. **YAML frontmatter** with complete metadata
2. **Executive Summary** for quick AI agent consumption
3. **Detailed Findings** with structured analysis
4. **Actionable Insights** for implementation
5. **Source References** for verification
6. **AI Agent Instructions** for future work

## Usage by AI Agents

When conducting research:

1. Follow the metadata schema in `metadata-schema.yaml`
2. Use templates from `templates/` folder
3. Structure findings for AI agent consumption
4. Include actionable recommendations
5. Cross-reference with existing knowledge base

## Quality Standards

- Objective analysis with clear methodology
- Multiple source verification where possible
- Clear distinction between facts and analysis
- Actionable insights for project improvement
- Structured for AI agent processing and human review
