# AI Research Framework

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive AI Research Framework with intelligent orchestration capabilities. The system provides 15 specialized research methods (11 existing + 4 advanced) with context-aware method selection and quality assurance.

## Key Capabilities

- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Context analysis automatically selects optimal research methods
- **15 Research Methods**: From simple step-by-step to complex multi-perspective approaches
- **Quality Enhancement**: Built-in validation using constitutional AI and self-consistency
- **Dual-Agent System**: Primary research + automatic evaluation and observation
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of decisions, timing, and outcomes

## Quick Start

1. **Request Research**: "Help me research [topic]"
2. **Orchestrator Analyzes**: Context complexity, domain, quality requirements
3. **Method Selection**: Appropriate research methods chosen automatically
4. **Research Execution**: AI agent conducts research using selected methods
5. **Quality Evaluation**: Test agent observes and evaluates process
