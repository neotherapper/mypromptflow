# Figma: Enterprise Design-to-Code Automation Platform

## Tool Overview

Figma represents a paradigm shift from traditional design tool to enterprise design-to-code automation platform through its Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration. This comprehensive documentation covers Figma's transformation into an AI-assisted development workflow cornerstone, emphasizing MCP server capabilities, enterprise licensing requirements, and sophisticated design-to-development automation patterns.

### Core Positioning

**Beyond Design Tool**: Figma has evolved from design collaboration platform to integrated development workflow component, bridging the designer-developer gap through AI-assisted code generation and design system automation.

**MCP Integration Reality**: The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server operates as a local SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint at `localhost:3845`, utilizing JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging to enable direct AI agent interaction with design components and specifications.

## MCP Server Capabilities and Architecture

### Technical Infrastructure

**Local Server Architecture**:
```yaml
Protocol Stack:
  Transport: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
  Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse
  Messaging: JSON-RPC 2.0
  Execution: Local-only (desktop app required)
  
Performance Metrics:
  Token Efficiency: 30-50% reduction vs screenshots
  Response Time: 15-510ms (size dependent)
  Error Rates: <5% connection, <10% timeout, <1% parsing
  Uptime: 99%+ (desktop app dependent)
```

**Core MCP Capabilities**:
- **Real-time Design Data Access**: Direct component specifications, design tokens, and layout information
- **Code Generation Context**: Structured design data enabling accurate code generation
- **Token Optimization**: 30-50% token reduction compared to screenshot-based workflows
- **Live Design Sync**: Real-time updates when design changes occur

### API Integration Patterns

**REST API Capabilities**:
```javascript
// Figma REST API Integration
const figmaAPI = {
  baseURL: 'https://api.figma.com/v1',
  endpoints: {
    files: '/files/:file_key',
    components: '/files/:file_key/components',
    componentSets: '/files/:file_key/component_sets',
    styles: '/files/:file_key/styles',
    images: '/images/:file_key'
  },
  rateLimit: '6,000 credits per minute',
  authentication: 'Personal Access Token or OAuth2'
}

// MCP Server Integration
const mcpIntegration = {
  protocol: 'JSON-RPC 2.0',
  transport: 'Server-Sent Events',
  endpoint: 'http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse',
  capabilities: [
    'get_selection_data',
    'get_component_info', 
    'get_design_tokens',
    'get_code_syntax'
  ]
}
```

**Webhook Integration**:
- **File Updates**: Real-time notifications when designs change
- **Component Modifications**: Automatic synchronization with code components
- **Design System Changes**: Token and style update propagation
- **Collaboration Events**: Team activity and approval workflow triggers

## Design-to-Code Workflow Automation

### Comprehensive Automation Pipeline

**Phase 1: Design System Preparation**
```markdown
1. **Component Naming Convention**
   - Component/State format (e.g., Button/Primary)
   - Icon/Name structure (e.g., Icon/Search)
   - Variant__Property pattern (e.g., Card__elevated__large)

2. **Design Token Architecture**
   - Variables for spacing, colors, typography
   - Code syntax provided in Figma
   - Framework-specific mappings
   - Version-controlled token management

3. **Code Connect Setup**
   - Link Figma components to codebase implementations
   - Provide code examples for AI consumption
   - Establish semantic relationships
```

**Phase 2: AI-Assisted Code Generation**
```typescript
// Automated Component Generation Workflow
interface FigmaToCodeWorkflow {
  input: {
