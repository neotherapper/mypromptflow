## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Maritime Data Intelligence Pipeline

```typescript
// Maritime-specific MCP integration pattern
interface MaritimeDataPipeline {
  // Data collection phase
  async collectVesselData(vesselId: string): Promise<VesselData> {
    const [webData, marketData, historicalData] = await Promise.all([
      brightData.scrapeVesselInformation(vesselId),
      perplexity.getMarketIntelligence(vesselId),
      postgresql.getHistoricalData(vesselId)
    ]);
    
    return this.correlateVesselData(webData, marketData, historicalData);
  }
  
  // Risk analysis phase
  async analyzeRisk(vesselData: VesselData): Promise<RiskAssessment> {
    const [aiAssessment, similarCases, marketTrends] = await Promise.all([
      anthropicClaude.assessInsuranceRisk(vesselData),
      qdrant.findSimilarRiskPatterns(vesselData),
      fetch.getMarketTrends(vesselData.category)
    ]);
    
    return this.generateRiskProfile(aiAssessment, similarCases, marketTrends);
  }
  
  // Decision support phase
  async generateRecommendations(riskAssessment: RiskAssessment): Promise<PolicyRecommendations> {
    const recommendations = await anthropicClaude.generatePolicyRecommendations(riskAssessment);
    
    // Store in memory for session continuity
    await memory.storeSessionData('risk_assessment', riskAssessment);
    await memory.storeSessionData('recommendations', recommendations);
    
    return recommendations;
  }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Maritime Compliance Automation

```typescript
// Compliance-focused MCP integration
interface MaritimeComplianceSystem {
  async performComplianceCheck(policyId: string): Promise<ComplianceReport> {
    // Security assessment
    const securityScan = await burpSuite.scanForVulnerabilities();
    
    // Data integrity validation
    const dataValidation = await postgresql.validateDataIntegrity(policyId);
    
    // Audit trail analysis
    const auditTrail = await splunk.generateAuditReport(policyId);
    
    // Generate compliance dashboard
    const complianceDashboard = await grafana.createComplianceDashboard({
      security: securityScan,
      data: dataValidation,
      audit: auditTrail
    });
    
    return {
      compliance_score: this.calculateComplianceScore(securityScan, dataValidation, auditTrail),
      dashboard_url: complianceDashboard.url,
      recommendations: await this.generateComplianceRecommendations()
    };
  }
}
```

### Pattern 3: Maritime Customer Experience Optimization

```typescript
// Customer-centric MCP integration
interface MaritimeCustomerExperience {
  async optimizeCustomerJourney(customerId: string): Promise<CustomerOptimization> {
    // CRM integration for customer insights
    const customerProfile = await salesforce.getCustomerProfile(customerId);
    
    // Marketing automation for personalized communication
    const marketingInsights = await hubspot.getCustomerInsights(customerId);
    
    // AI-powered personalization
    const personalizedRecommendations = await anthropicClaude.generatePersonalizedInsurance({
      profile: customerProfile,
      insights: marketingInsights,
      industry: 'maritime'
    });
    
    // Store optimization results
    await notion.createCustomerOptimizationPlan({
      customer_id: customerId,
      recommendations: personalizedRecommendations,
      implementation_plan: await this.createImplementationPlan()
    });
    
    return {
      optimization_score: this.calculateOptimizationScore(),
      recommendations: personalizedRecommendations,
      next_actions: await this.generateNextActions()
    };
  }
}
```
