# Flag Combination Rules
combination_rules:
  persona_exclusivity:
    rule: "Only one persona flag per command"
    enforcement: "Last persona flag takes precedence"
    
  analysis_depth_exclusivity:
    rule: "Only one analysis depth flag per command"
    enforcement: "Higher depth takes precedence"
    
  optimization_compatibility:
    rule: "Optimization flags can be combined with any other flags"
    enforcement: "Multiple optimization flags are additive"

# Integration Patterns
command_integration:
  flag_parsing:
    pattern: "Command followed by flags"
    example: "implement user auth --backend --think-hard --token-optimized"
    
  flag_inheritance:
    pattern: "Flags apply to all sub-operations"
    example: "Complex workflows inherit persona and depth flags"
    
  flag_override:
    pattern: "Later flags override earlier conflicting flags"
    example: "--think --ultrathink" results in ultrathink mode

# Quality Standards
validation_requirements:
  - "Personas must enhance command execution appropriately"
  - "Analysis depth must be proportional to task complexity"
  - "Optimization flags must maintain output quality"
  - "Flag combinations must be logically consistent"

# Usage Examples
examples:
  development:
    - "implement REST API --backend --think"
    - "design system architecture --architect --ultrathink"

  analysis:
    - "analyze security vulnerabilities --security --ultrathink"
    - "troubleshoot performance issues --performance --think-hard"
    - "explain complex algorithm --mentor --compressed"
