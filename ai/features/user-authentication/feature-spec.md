# Feature Specification: User Authentication

## Overview

Secure, user-friendly authentication system supporting multiple authentication methods including email/password, social login, and two-factor authentication.

## Problem Statement

Users need a secure way to access their accounts while maintaining ease of use. Current market solutions often sacrifice usability for security or vice versa. Our target users (small business owners) need both without complexity.

## Solution Approach

Implement a progressive authentication system that starts simple but allows users to add security layers as needed. Use industry-standard protocols (OAuth 2.0, JWT) with intuitive UI/UX.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 95% successful login rate
- [ ] < 2 second authentication time
- [ ] < 3% password reset requests
- [ ] Zero security breaches
- [ ] 90% users enable 2FA within 30 days

## Scope

### In Scope

- Email/password authentication
- Social login (Google, Microsoft)
- Two-factor authentication
- Password reset flow
- Remember me functionality
- Session management

### Out of Scope

- Biometric authentication (future release)
- SSO for enterprise (future release)
- Hardware token support

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- User database schema
- Email service for notifications
- SMS service for 2FA
- Redis for session storage

### Business Dependencies

- Privacy policy approval
- Terms of service update
- Security audit completion

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                  | Impact | Mitigation                       |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Brute force attacks   | High   | Rate limiting, account lockout   |
| Session hijacking     | High   | Secure cookies, session rotation |
| Weak passwords        | Medium | Password strength requirements   |
| Social login downtime | Low    | Fallback to email/password       |

## AI Agent Instructions

When implementing this feature:

1. Start with `technical/api-contracts.md` for endpoint definitions
2. Use security patterns from `@ai/knowledge/technical/security/security-architecture.md`
3. Follow authentication flow in `design/interaction-flow.md`
4. Implement comprehensive tests as per `tests/test-strategy.md`
5. Ensure OWASP compliance throughout
