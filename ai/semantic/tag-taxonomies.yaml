# Tag Relationship Rules
tag_relationships:
  # Hierarchical Relationships
  hierarchical:
    parent_child:
      rule: "Child tags inherit parent characteristics"
      example: "technical-api inherits from technical"
      
    sibling:
      rule: "Sibling tags share parent characteristics"
      example: "tier1 and tier2 are both AI processing levels"
      
  # Semantic Relationships
  semantic:
    synonyms:
      rule: "Tags with similar meanings are grouped"
      example: "api, endpoints, integration are related"
      
    antonyms:
      rule: "Opposite concepts are explicitly linked"
      example: "current-state vs future-state"
      
    related_concepts:
      rule: "Thematically related tags are connected"
      example: "user-research relates to personas, journey-mapping"

# Tag Usage Guidelines
usage_guidelines:
  # Tagging Best Practices
  best_practices:
    - "Use specific tags rather than generic ones"
    - "Include both category and functional tags"
    - "Balance specificity with discoverability"
    - "Maintain consistent tag vocabulary"
    - "Regular review and cleanup of unused tags"
    
  # Common Tagging Patterns
  patterns:
    document_type_pattern:
      format: "{category}-{document-type}"
      example: "technical-api-documentation"
      
    workflow_stage_pattern:
      format: "{stage}-{focus}"
      example: "planning-requirements"
      
    relationship_pattern:
      format: "{relationship}-{target}"
      example: "depends-on-user-research"
      
    quality_pattern:
      format: "{quality-aspect}-{level}"
      example: "tier1-highest-value"
