# Success Metrics
success_criteria:
  path_identification:
    confidence_minimum: 0.8
    fallback_action: "Ask clarifying questions"
  
  recommendation_quality:
    requirements:
      - "Specific document sequence provided"
      - "Clear rationale for each document"
      - "Actionable next step command"
      - "Realistic effort estimates"
  
  user_understanding:
    validation_questions:
      - "Do you understand why we're starting with [first_document]?"
      - "Does this sequence make sense for your project?"
      - "Are you ready to begin with the suggested command?"

# Error Recovery
error_handling:
  unclear_responses:
    strategy: "Ask targeted clarifying questions"
    example: "When you say 'business tool', do you mean internal company use or selling to other businesses?"
  
  conflicting_information:
    strategy: "Highlight conflicts and ask for resolution"
    example: "You mentioned both 'just an idea' and 'have requirements ready' - which better describes your current stage?"
  
  edge_cases:
    strategy: "Provide multiple options and let user choose"
    example: "Your project could follow either path A or B. Which resonates more with your situation?"
